            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE By way of PREFACE,</head>
            <head type="sub">To all Truth's Friends and Friendly Readers, Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In the dear and tender Love of my Heavenly Father, which by his dear Son and bleſſed Spirit, he hath plentifully ſhed abroad in many Hearts in this glorious Goſpel-Day; Glory to his worthy Name and excellent Power for ever.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am concerned to recommend the ſerious reading and peruſal of the enſuing <hi>Collection,</hi> unto all who ſincerely deſire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Chriſt's Kingdom, and Proſperity of his Church and <hi>Sion,</hi> in true Love, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Order, in and by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Head and Foundation thereof.</p>
            <p>And that none of you would think the peruſal of theſe <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> weariſom or tedious, becauſe the ſame Words and Things in many of them may ſeem frequently repeated, there being numerous Evangelical Truths, and variety of good and wholſom Matter, as well as diverſities of <hi>Epiſties,</hi> containing much Chriſtian Counſel to many various States and Conditions of enlightned and enlivened Souls travelling and breathing to God; ſo that the frequent intermix'd Repetitions of the ſame neceſſary <hi>Truths</hi> may be the better allowed and born with in the Reading. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the moderate and ingenious Reader will not be offended thereat: It being a thing frequent in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> to have the ſame <hi>Goſpel-Truths</hi> often repeated, which many dull and forgetful Perſons have need to be often told of ſuch Matters, of ſo great Importance. The Author's <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and <hi>Matters</hi> of moſt general Concern are here collected, to avoid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity and unneceſſary Repetitions, as much as could be.</p>
            <p>The Simplicity and Plainneſs of the Author's Stile is not to be deſpiſed, he being more in Life and Subſtance than in the Wiſdom of Words, or Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Speech. And the Lord being pleaſed in his Day to make great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of him, and to do great Things by him, for his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Seed's</hi> ſake; of which there yet remains Clouds of Witneſſes, even to that Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:96751:3"/>and hidden Wiſdom of God (in the Myſtery of Chriſt) which was with him, and ſupported him, and lifted up his Head thorow many great Fights, of Afflictions and Trials.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I have not read or heard all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in the enſuing <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;</hi> but many of them, which I know to be very ſeaſonable, weighty and neceſſary; and therefore have cauſe to believe ſo of the reſt, which I have not read. But, by our long and frequent Converſation, Knowledge and Intimacy (together with his living and revived Teſtimonies, his godly Care and Zeal for Truth's Honour and Proſperity) I have deeply read, and known the Author, his unfeigned Love, Innocency and Integrity, in the bleſſed Living Truth, whoſe Chriſtian Care (among many other things relating to the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Union, <hi>Good Order and Diſcipline</hi>
               </hi> thereof greatly was, That no Offence in any thing might be given; that the Miniſtry might not be blamed; well-knowing what Trials and Proofs attended <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miniſters and Miniſtry in theſe latter Days (in ſome degree) as in the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> Times; namely, that he (with many others in his Day) approved himſelf, and themſelves, as the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in much Patience, in deep Afflictions, in Neceſſities, in Diſtreſſes (and ſome in Stripes and cruel Beatings) in Priſons, in Tumults, in Labours by Watchings, and by Faſtings, by Purity, by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by Long-ſuffering, by Kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the Word of Truth, by the <hi>Power of God,</hi> by the Armour of Righteouſneſs, on the Right-hand, and on the Left, by Honour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, by evil Report and good Report; as deceivers, and yet true, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Cor. 6.</hi> In which Proofs of God's Miniſters, this his Ancient Servant had a deep ſhare, and the true Root of the Matter was in him, far beyond his Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>And though many falſe Predictions, Propheſies, and cruel Threats were early breathed out by Perſecators and envious Spirits againſt Him, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> (whom he unfeignedly loved) and againſt His and Our Holy Profeſſion, Way and Teſtimony, as if in a very ſhort time all would come to nought, and be laid waſte; yet they have all been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and proved falſe, and his Chriſtian Living Teſtimony and Work further manifeſt to be of God, and not of Men, nor of the Will of Man: For Truth, that's ſtrongeſt of all, hath ſtill prevailed, and muſt prevail. And though the Memory of this our deceaſed Brother and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be ſtill greatly Envied, and be moſt groſly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, by ſome implacable Adverſaries, and hardned Apoſtates, who could not obtain their evil Ends, and deſtractive Deſigns, againſt him in his Life-time; yet his Memory is truly Precious to many Thouſands, who truly Fear God and Love his Truth, who have a true Inward Senſe, That ſuch a Divine Power and Providence attended him in his Innocent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Teſtimony, Miniſtry, Labours, and Sufferings, that the <hi>Devil</hi> and all perſecuting Agents, could never ſtop nor fruſtrate his Teſtimony or Service, in turning many to Righteouſneſs, even from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</p>
            <p>In many of the enſuing <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> he often mentions the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and the like; whereby he intends no other than what
<pb facs="tcp:96751:3"/>the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> teſtifie of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which, we know, he truly loved and eſteemed, and was often converſant in reading of them, and had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Memory and ſpiritual Sence thereof given him of the Lord. By the <hi>pure holy Seed,</hi> he meant and declared <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>promiſed Seed;</hi> wherein <hi>all the Promiſes of God are Yea and Amen.</hi> And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Word of God, the Word of Life, the Word of Faith,</hi> he is that immortal and incorruptible <hi>Seed,</hi> of which all true and ſpiritual Believers and Children of the <hi>Light</hi> are begotten to God, and born again; and which <hi>Seed,</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> abideth in him that is born of God, and ſinneth not becauſe thereof, <hi>1 John 3.</hi> And as the Generation of God, and Children of his Kingdom, and of the Promiſe, are called the <hi>good Seed, and counted for the Seed,</hi> being born of that <hi>Incorruptible Seed,</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Life, which endureth for ever, 1 Peter 1.23, 15.</hi> And being that bleſſed <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Holy Generation,</hi> which was foretold <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſee, and for which the travel of his Soul was, <hi>Iſa. 53.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our deceaſed Friend and Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> truly teſtified of him in all Reſpects, both as come in the Fleſh and in the Spirit, both as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was and is our only Mediator and Advocate, and as he was and is God over all, bleſſed for ever; whom he ſo dearly loved and honoured, that he often offered up his Life, and deeply ſuffered for him; and that in dear and conſtant Love to <hi>his Seed,</hi> that a holy <hi>Generation</hi> might be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſtrengthned, and increaſed in the Earth among the Children of Men. And his knowledge and Miniſtry of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> being after the Spirit in Life and Power, did no ways imply, any leſſening of the Dignity or Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor any defect of Faith or Love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he came and ſuffered in the Fleſh for Mankind, as ſome Adverſaries have injuriouſly miſrepreſented and aſperſed him; for he highly eſteemed <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Death, Reſurrection, and Glory; and powerfully teſtified of the Vertue, Power, bleſſed and ſpirtual Deſign, Fruit and Effects thereof, as revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and witneſſed by his Holy Spirit. And as we have no cauſe to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but as with this innocent and good Man, <hi>to live was Chriſt;</hi> ſo, <hi>to die was Gain;</hi> in both which he glorified God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> being our Spiritual Rock, Foundation and Head, he is truly precious to us and all true Believers, in all States and Conditions, both of his Humiliation, Glory and Dominion; his great Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appearing in thoſe precious Miniſterial Gifts given by him (when he aſcended up on high) for his Miniſtry and Church.</p>
            <p>And 'tis very obſervable, that though to expreſs <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Lowly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Appearance in the World, He is ſometimes in <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> termed the <hi>Seed;</hi> His Name is alſo called <hi>Wonderful Counſellor,</hi> the <hi>Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace: Upon whoſe Shoulders the Government is laid: And of the increaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no end,</hi> Iſaiah <hi>9.</hi> And 'tis moſt ſuitable to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s low, humble and ſuffering Condition, to make uſe of ſuch Inſtruments as are moſt like himſelf in Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind; although they be but low and mean in the World's Eye and Eſteem: God is pleaſed to make choice of low, mean and weak things (and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments contemptible in the Eyes of the high and lofty ones of this World)
<pb facs="tcp:96751:4"/>to confound the Wiſdom of the World, according to <hi>1 Cor 1.</hi> He choſe poor Shepherds to divulge that great Evangelical Truth of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Birth; and certain <hi>Women</hi> to preach that Goſpel-Truth of his Reſurrection, <hi>Luke 2. &amp; 24.</hi> And both from Angelical Teſtimony, as well as from their ſight of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: Truth muſt not be rejected becauſe of ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God in his Wiſdom is pleaſed to employ in his Work; nor the Day of ſmall things deſpiſed: From <hi>ſmall</hi> Beginnings of good Matters, great Things, glorious Attainments and Perfections do ſpring. Glory, Honour and Dominion, to our moſt Gracious God, and to the Lamb on his Throne, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, dear and well-beloved</hi> Friends, <hi>all live in</hi> Love <hi>and</hi> Peace, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the</hi> true Faith, peaceable <hi>and</hi> good Example <hi>of the</hi> Faithful <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the</hi> God <hi>of</hi> Love <hi>and</hi> Peace <hi>will be with you.</hi>

               <head>A <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> how the Lord ſent <hi>G.F.</hi> forth at firſt, in the Year <hi>1643.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHEN the <hi>Lord</hi> firſt ſent me forth in the Year 1643.<note place="margin">The Year when the Lord firſt ſent <hi>G.F.</hi> forth to declare his Truth.</note> I was ſent as an Innocent <hi>Lamb</hi> (and Young in Years) amongſt <hi>(Men in the Nature of) Wolves, Dogs, Bears, Lions</hi> and <hi>Tigres</hi> into the World, which the <hi>Devil</hi> had made like a Wilderneſs, no right Way <hi>then</hi> found out of it. And I was ſent <hi>To Turn People from Darkneſs to the Light,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> did Enlighten them withal; that ſo they might ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which he doth pour upon all Fleſh, that with it they might have an Underſtanding to know the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to know him, and his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is Eternal Life; and ſo might worſhip and ſerve the Living <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creator,</hi> who takes Care for all, who is <hi>Lord</hi> of all; and with the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> they might know the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which were given forth from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Saints, and Holy Men and Women of God.</p>
               <p>And when many began to be turned to the <hi>Light</hi> (which is the Life in Chriſt) and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which gave them an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and had found the <hi>Path</hi> of the <hi>Juſt,</hi> the Shining <hi>Light,</hi> then did the <hi>Wolves, Dogs, Dragons, Bears, Lions, Tigres,</hi> Wild <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey</hi> make a Roaring and a Screeching Noiſe againſt the <hi>Lambs, Sheep, Doves</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were ready
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96751:5"/>to devour them and me, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1644"/> and to tear us to pieces. But the Lord's Arm and Power did preſerve me; though many times I was in Danger of my Life, and very often caſt into <hi>Dungeons</hi> and <hi>Priſons,</hi> and haled before <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> But all things did work together for good: And the more I was caſt into outward <hi>Priſons,</hi> the more People came out of their Spiritual and Inward <hi>Priſon</hi> (through the Preaching of the Goſpel) But the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were in ſuch a great Rage, and made the Rude and Profane People in ſuch a Fury, that I could hardly walk in the Streets, or go in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but they were ready oft-times to do me a Miſchief. But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who hath all Power in Heaven and in the Earth, did ſo reſtrain and limit them with his Power, that my Life was preſerved; though many times I was near killed.</p>
               <p>Oh! the Burdens and Travels, that I went under! Often my Life preſt down under the Spirits of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> without Life, and the <hi>Profane!</hi> And beſides, the Troubles <hi>afterwards</hi> with <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders, Apoſtates</hi> and <hi>falſe Brethren,</hi> which were like ſo many <hi>Judas</hi>'s in betraying the <hi>Truth,</hi> and God's Faithful and Choſen Seed, and cauſing the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to be evil ſpoken of! But the Lord blaſted, waſted and confounded them, ſo that none did ſtand long; for the Lord did either deſtroy them, or bring them to nought, and his <hi>Truth</hi> did flouriſh, and his People in it, to the Praiſe of God, who is the Revenger of his Choſen.</p>

               <p>AND the <hi>Truth</hi> ſprang up firſt (<hi>to us, as to be a People to the Lord</hi>) in <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> in 1644. and in <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> in 1645. and in <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> in 1646. and in <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> in 1647. and in the adjacent Countries in 1648. 1649. and 1650. and in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> in 1651. and in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> in 1652. and in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi> in 1653. and in <hi>London,</hi> and moſt parts of the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in 1654. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And in 1656. Truth brake forth in <hi>America,</hi> and many other places.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96751:5"/>
               <p>And <hi>Friends</hi> never feared their <hi>Acts,</hi> nor <hi>Priſons,</hi> nor <hi>Goals,</hi> nor <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Correction,</hi> nor <hi>Baniſhments,</hi> nor <hi>Spoilings</hi> of Goods; nay, nor <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf. And there was never any <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that came, but we ſaw, it was for <hi>Good;</hi> and we looked upon it to be <hi>Good,</hi> as from <hi>God:</hi> And there was never any <hi>Priſons,</hi> that I was in, or <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> but ſtill it was for the bringing Multitudes more out of <hi>Priſon:</hi> For they that Impriſoned the <hi>Truth,</hi> and Quenched the <hi>Spirit</hi> in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> would priſon it, and quench it <hi>without them.</hi> So that there was a Time, when there were ſo many in <hi>Priſon,</hi> that it became as a By-word, <hi>Truth</hi> was <hi>ſcarcely any where to be found, but in Goals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after that the <hi>King</hi> came in, divers <hi>Friends</hi> ſuffered much, becauſe they would not <hi>Drink</hi> the <hi>King's Health,</hi> and ſay,<note place="margin">Sufferings for not Drinking the King's Health.</note> 
                  <hi>God bleſs the King;</hi> ſo that many times <hi>Friends</hi> were in Danger of their Lives by rude Perſons, who were ready to run them through with their Swords for refuſing it; until the <hi>King</hi> gave forth a <hi>Proclamation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Drinking Healths.</hi> For we were and are againſt all <hi>Drinking Healths</hi> and <hi>Exceſs,</hi> both before his Coming in, and after; and we deſire the <hi>King</hi>'s good, and that the Bleſſings of God might come upon him, and all his Subjects, and all People upon the Face of the Earth. <q>And we did deſire People not to <hi>Drink</hi> the <hi>King's Health,</hi> but let him have his <hi>Health,</hi> and all People elſe; and ſo to <hi>Drink</hi> for their own <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> only: For that way of <hi>Drinking Healths,</hi> and to <hi>Exceſs,</hi> was not for the <hi>King's Health,</hi> nor their own, nor any others. Which <hi>Exceſs</hi> often brought forth Quarrelling and Deſtroying one another; for they deſtroyed the Creation, and one another: And this was not for the King's <hi>Wealth,</hi> nor <hi>Health</hi> nor <hi>Honour;</hi> but might grieve him to have the Creatures deſtroyed, and his Subjects.</q> And ſo, the Lord's Power gave us Dominion over that alſo, and all our other <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Oh! the Number of <hi>Sufferers</hi> in the <hi>Common Wealth</hi>'s days, and in <hi>O. Protector</hi>'s days, and ſince! But eſpecially they, that were haled before their <hi>Courts,</hi> for not paying <hi>Tithes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sufferings for Tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>O. C</hi>'s days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>not Swearing</hi> in their <hi>Juries,</hi> and for not putting off their <hi>Hats,</hi> and for going to <hi>Meetings</hi> on the <hi>Firſt-Days</hi> (under pretence of breaking the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) and other Meetings in the <hi>Week-Days;</hi> who were abuſed both in the <hi>Meetings,</hi> and on the <hi>High-ways!</hi> Oh,<note place="margin">Sufferings for Meetings.</note> how great were the <hi>Sufferings</hi> we then ſuſtained upon theſe Accounts! For ſometimes they would drive <hi>Friends</hi> by Droves into the Priſon-houſes (like <hi>Penfolds</hi>) and there keep them on the <hi>Firſt-Days;</hi> and then take their <hi>Horſes</hi> from them, and keep them for pretended <hi>Breach</hi> of their <hi>Sabbath:</hi> Though they would Ride in their Coaches, and upon their Fat Horſes to the Steeple-houſes themſelves, and yet puniſh others. And many Friends were turned out of their Copyholds and Cuſtomary Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they could not <hi>Swear;</hi> And as they went to <hi>Meetings,</hi> they have been <hi>Stoned</hi> through the Streets, and cruelly abuſed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.<note place="margin">Sufferings for the Hat.</note> And many were Fined with great <hi>Fines,</hi> and lay long in <hi>Priſon</hi> for not putting off their <hi>Hats;</hi> but <hi>Friends</hi> could never pay them, though they kept them in <hi>Priſon,</hi> till they had ſatisfied their own Wills upon them; and at laſt turned them out, after they had kept them a <hi>Year,</hi> or more, in <hi>Priſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96751:6"/>
               <p>And many <hi>Friends</hi> were exceedingly <hi>ſpoiled</hi> in their Eſtates and Goods in the <hi>petty-Courts</hi> for <hi>Tithes,</hi> till we got a <hi>Prohibition</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> out of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> that <hi>then</hi> threw the Trial of ſuch things out of their <hi>petty-Courts,</hi> that they might ſue for them in the <hi>Courts</hi> at <hi>London:</hi> And my Deſire is, that the Lord may open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings alſo (if it be his Will) to throw them out of thoſe <hi>Courts</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>And many <hi>Books</hi> I gave forth againſt <hi>Tithes,</hi> and how the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> was changed, that took them: And that Chriſt ſent forth his 12 (and after, 70) <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and ſaid unto them; <hi>Freely</hi> they had <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> they were to <hi>give.</hi> And ſo all that are Tranſgreſſors, and do not obey the Doctrine and Command of Chriſt therein, we cannot receive them.</p>
               <p>And many <hi>ſuffered</hi> for not <hi>Swearing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concerning not Swearing.</note> both before and ſince the <hi>King</hi> came in; becauſe they could not <hi>Swear</hi> in Obedience to the Command of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle's,</hi> who forbad all <hi>Swearing.</hi> And <hi>Tenths</hi> were offered up in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> but all muſt be offered up in the time of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi>'s ſake. For there were no <hi>Tithes</hi> nor <hi>Swearing</hi> before the <hi>Fall;</hi> and ſo there are none again to be in the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> by Chriſt. And though <hi>Swearing</hi> was in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> yet our <hi>Yea</hi> is to be <hi>Yea,</hi> and our <hi>Nay</hi> to be <hi>Nay</hi> in the time of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſeveral <hi>Books</hi> I was moved to give forth againſt <hi>Swearing,</hi> and that our <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> might be taken inſtead of an <hi>Oath;</hi> and if we broke that, let us ſuffer the ſame Puniſhment, that they did, that broke their <hi>Oaths.</hi> And in <hi>Jamaica</hi> the <hi>Governor</hi> granted the thing, and the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Friends Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings about Swearing, and ſomething open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>G. F.</hi> concerning Oaths.</note> and it is alſo granted in ſome other Places: And ſeveral of the <hi>Parliament-Men</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have acknowledged the Reaſonableneſs of the thing. For the true <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was but to tie People to <hi>ſwear</hi> by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to ſay, and to do <hi>Truth,</hi> ſince Man and Woman fell, in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> and not before the <hi>Fall:</hi> And this was the <hi>Oath,</hi> that Chriſt came to fulfil and end; and he ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And I ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> fulfils and ends this <hi>Oath,</hi> which Men were to perform to the Lord, who performs <hi>God's Oath,</hi> which he ſware by himſelf, and fulfils that; and he ſets up <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay</hi> inſtead thereof: Concerning which I and my Friends have written at large in our <hi>Books</hi> touching this Subject. And the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> after ſome time, when they ſaw our Faithfulneſs in <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> they that were Moderate (both before and ſince the <hi>King</hi> came in) would put Friends into <hi>Offices</hi> without an <hi>Oath:</hi> But they that were Cruel and Envious, would <hi>fine Friends</hi> to get Money of them; though <hi>Friends</hi> could not pay them any.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> hath carried us through all, and over all, to his Everlaſting Glory and Praiſe! For <hi>God's Power,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Devil</hi>'s was, hath been our Hedge, our Wall, and our Keeper, and the Preſerver of his <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Vineyard,</hi> who have not had the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Sword</hi> and <hi>Staff</hi> to help them, nor never truſted in the <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>Fleſh:</hi> And have gone without <hi>Judas</hi> his <hi>Bag,</hi> or the <hi>Magiſtrates Sword</hi> and <hi>Staff</hi> to preach the <hi>Word of</hi> Life, which was in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before they were; which <hi>Word</hi> reconciles to <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> have received the Word of Reconciliation, and are born again
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96751:6"/>of the Immortal Seed by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and are feeding upon the Milk of the Word, which lives, and abides, and endures for ever. And many have ſuffered to <hi>Death</hi> for their Teſtimony, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> both before and ſince the <hi>King</hi> came in; which ye may ſee, as followeth:</p>
               <p>This was given to the <hi>King</hi> and both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> being <q>
                     <hi>A brief, and plain, and true Relation of the late and ſad Sufferings of the People of God in ſcorn called</hi> Quakers, <hi>for worſhipping and exerciſing a good Conſcience towards God and Man.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By reaſon whereof <hi>Eighty nine</hi> have ſuffered till <hi>Death</hi> (<hi>Thirty two</hi> of which died before the <hi>King</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Fifty ſeven</hi> ſince, by hard Impriſonment and cruel Uſage) <hi>Forty three</hi> have <hi>died</hi> in the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> ſince the Act was made againſt <hi>Meetings,</hi> &amp;c.</q> (about 1661.) They have thus ſuffered; of which a more particular Account was given (with their Names, that did ſuffer) to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> (about 1663.)</p>
               <p>And tho' divers <hi>Laws</hi> were deſigned againſt us,<note place="margin">How Friends ſuffered, and of their Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Acts,</hi> that have been made, ſince the King came in.</note> yet never could any of them juſtly touch us, neither did they truly concern us, tho' they did execute them unjuſtly upon us; and they knew, we were not the <hi>People</hi> juſtly chargeable; and ſome have been made to confeſs it. And all thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that were already made, and the <hi>Oath,</hi> which they impriſon'd us for (becauſe we could not <hi>Swear</hi> at all, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Command of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) were never <hi>originally</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt us. And yet we ſuffered by the ſeveral <hi>Powers</hi> and their <hi>Laws</hi> (tho' they did not concern us) both <hi>ſpoiling</hi> of <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> even to <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. And the Governor of <hi>Dover</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when the King asked him, If he had diſperſed all the <hi>Sectaries Meetings?</hi> He ſaid, That <hi>he had; but the</hi> Quakers, <hi>the</hi> Devil <hi>himſelf could not: For if that he did Impriſon them, and break them up, they would Meet again; and if he ſhould beat them, and knock them down, or kill ſome of them, all was one; they would meet, and not reſiſt again.</hi> — And thus the Lord's Power did ſupport them, and keep them over their Perſecutors; and made them to Juſtify our Patience and Lamb-like Nature. This was about 1671.</p>
               <p>And ſince the King came in, <hi>Three Acts</hi> have been made againſt us by the King and Parliament, (beſides the <hi>Proclamations</hi>) by which many have ſuffered <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> and <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> and many to Death. And yet for all theſe Acts and Proclamations, and Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Perſecutions, and Sufferings, Faithful Friends are as freſh as ever, in the Lord's Power, and Valiant for his Name and Truth. And ſome <hi>Weak Ones</hi> there were, when the King came in, that did <hi>Swear,</hi> and take the <hi>Oaths;</hi> but after, when they had ſo done, they were ſore troubled for diſobeying the Command of Chriſt, and the Apoſtle, that they went to the Magiſtrates, and condemned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and offered themſelves to go to Priſon. And thus the Lord, in his Everlaſting Power, hath been the Support and Stay of his People.</p>
               <p>And when the Glorious <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> was ſpread over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they had received the Word of Life,<note place="margin">Quarterly and Monthly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſet up.</note> then firſt the <hi>Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and ſome <hi>Monthly Meetings,</hi> were ſettled throughout the Nation; and then after, as Truth more and more ſpread, the <hi>Monthly Mens-Meetings,</hi> in 1667 and 1668.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96751:7"/>
               <p>And then alſo ſome <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> were ſet up; and after the <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> throughout the Nation, and other Nations were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto, and ſet up and eſtabliſhed throughout the Nations. For I was ſent for to many <hi>ſick People:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Womens Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſet up, and the occaſion of it.</note> 
                  <q>And at one time I was ſent for to <hi>White-Chappel,</hi> about the third Hour in the Morning, to a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that was <hi>dying,</hi> and her <hi>Child;</hi> and the People was weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her. And after a while I was moved (in the Name and Power of Chriſt Jeſus) to ſpeak to the Woman; and ſhe and her Child was raiſed up: And ſhe got up, to the Aſtoniſhment of the People, when they came in, in the Morning; and her Child alſo was healed.</q> And when I came to <hi>G. Roberts</hi>'s Houſe, about <hi>Eight</hi> in the Morning, there came in <hi>Sarah Blackberry</hi> to complain to me of the Poor, and how many poor Friends were in Want; and the Lord had ſhewed me, what I ſhould do, in his Eternal Power and Wiſdom.<note place="margin">How <hi>G.F.</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Friends to Viſit the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> So, I ſpake to her, to bid about <hi>Sixty Women</hi> to meet me about the <hi>firſt</hi> Hour in the Afternoon, at the Sign of the <hi>Helmet,</hi> at a Friends Houſe: And they did ſo accordingly, ſuch as were ſenſible <hi>Women</hi> of the Lord's Truth, and fearing God. And what the Lord had opened unto me, <q>I declared unto them, concerning their having a <hi>Meeting once a Week, every Second Day,</hi> that they might ſee and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of all poor Friends,<note place="margin">The Service of Womens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> who were Sick and Weak, and were in Wants, or Widows and Fatherleſs in the City and Suburbs.)</q> And ſo, they bleſt the Lord for the Wiſdom of God, that had ſettled ſuch a <hi>Meeting</hi> in his Power amongſt them: For they ſaw, that all that were <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Power of God, were to take their poſſeſſion of the Power of God, the Goſpel and its Order, which was, before the Devil was. And this brought them into the Practice of the pure Religion, and to Viſit the Sick, and for the Relief of the Fatherleſs and the Widow, and to ſee, that nothing was lacking amongſt them; and that they, in viſiting the Sick in the Lord's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Word, through it they would have the Wiſdom of the Lord, and of his Creation, and how to adminiſter his Creatures, and by the ſame Power to heal and ſtrengthen with the outward things, and without them. Which they have felt proſperous to this day; and great things have been done in their <hi>Meetings</hi> by the Lord's Power, and very honourable it hath been in the Eyes of all the Faithful, yea, and commendable in the World alſo.</p>
               <p>And afterwards the ſame <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> were ſettled up and down the Nation, and beyond the Seas in the Power of the Lord, which was, before the Devil was; into which Power of the Lord no <hi>Sect</hi> nor <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> can come, but Peace and Unity. And the Power of the Lord, the Goſpel, is the Authority of all the <hi>Mens</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> and all the Heirs of the Power, the Goſpel, both Men and Women are to take their poſſeſſions of the Inheritance of the Power of God, which is over the Devil: So, in it nothing can get betwixt them and the Lord God.</p>
               <p>And at the Settling of the <hi>Mens-Meetings</hi> in the Goſpel, the Power of God,<note place="margin">A Mens-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> I let them ſee, how they had a <hi>Mens-Meeting</hi> in the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion amongſt the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> of ſuch as were <hi>faithful Men, and full of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and theſe were to ſee in the Lords Power and Wiſdom, that nothing was <hi>lacking.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96751:7"/>
               <p>For ſince the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> denied the <hi>Jews</hi> Temple,<note place="margin">1650</note> Store-Houſe and Prieſts, where the Widows, Strangers and Fatherleſs were relieved; they ſet up a <hi>Mens-Meeting</hi> in the Power of God, and in the Holy Ghoſt, (and they had <hi>Deaconneſſes</hi> alſo) to ſee, that Widows, Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Strangers were relieved, and that nothing was wanting among them. Now, tho' this Practice hath been loſt ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Days, ſince Men have gone from the Power of God, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, that the Apoſtles were in, (and therefore are the Streets and Country ſo full of Widows, Strangers and Beggars,<note place="margin">From whence Wants come.</note> and ſo full of <hi>Wants,</hi> who want the Senſe of the good Spirit, and Power to open their Hearts, as the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians were in.) But the Everlaſting Goſpel being preached again by the ſame Holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles were in; and received from Heaven, as they received it; and many <hi>Thouſands</hi> having received this Goſpel now again, <hi>Mens-Meetings</hi> are ſet up (as were in the Days of the Apoſtles) in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and in the Holy Ghoſt: And <hi>Womens-Meetings</hi> as Mothers, and that they may be Teachers of good Things, and ſo to ſee, that nothing be lacking amongſt them; and ſo to do Good unto all, but eſpecially to the <hi>Houſhold</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, the Power of God is the Authority of both our <hi>Mens</hi> and <hi>Womens-Meetings,</hi> and all our other <hi>Meetings;</hi> which Power of God was, before the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> was from the Apoſtles, and before the Fall and the Devil was, and is over all; and all are to take their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of it, and in it to do God's Service and Buſineſs. So theſe <hi>Meetings</hi> are for the Converted and Elect, <hi>before the World began,</hi> and ſuch as are Heirs of the Power, and do poſſeſs it; and what they do and act in the Spirit and Power of God, they do it in that, which ſhall never have an End, to the Glory of God for ever, <hi>Amen!</hi>

               <p>THE Children of the Devil,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 2.</note> how expert are they in <hi>Evil,</hi> in all Deceit in his Kingdom; and yet they may ſpeak of the things of God: but no Vulturous Eye nor Venemous Beaſt ever trod in the Steps of the Juſt, though they may talk of the VVay. For who have their Converſation in this World, and only mind the Things of this World, in vain do they profeſs <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Children of God, who are conceived and begotten of him, are not of this World, neither do they mind only the Things of this World, but the Things which are Eternal: But the Children of this World do moſtly mind the External Things,<note place="margin">The World's Love.</note> and their Love is in them, and the other live by Faith; the one is ſanctified by the Word, the other painted with the Words. The Children of God are pure in Heart, not looking only at the Outſide: The Favour of the World and Friendſhip thereof is Enmity to God, Man may ſoon be ſtained with it. O love the Stranger, and be as Strangers in the World, and to the World! For they that followed Chriſt in his Croſs, they were Strangers in the World, and VVonders to the World, and condemned by the World; and the World knew him not, neither doth it them that follow him now. So, marvel not, if the World hate you; for the World lieth in hatred and wickedneſs. Who love this World, are Enemies to Chriſt; and who love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and have him for their Lord over them, they are Redeemed out of the World. The World would have a Chriſt, but not to rule over them; the Nature of the World is above Chriſt in Man, until Chriſt hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued that Nature in Man. While the Nature of the World doth rule in Man, Oh the deaf Ears and blind Eyes, and the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that are all ſhut up amongſt them, <hi>with which they Judge!</hi> But who love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do not mind the World's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor are troubled at it; but conſider all our Brethren, who have gone before us.</p>
               <p>When ye think ye are paſt all Croſſes, when the Trial doth come, ye will find a Croſs to that <hi>Will,</hi> which doth meddle with the things of God preſumptuouſly; that Man may live in Joy, but the Spirit is in Bondage.<note place="margin">Fleſhly Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> Rejoyce not in the Fleſh, but in the Spirit, which crucifieth all fleſhly Boaſtings; if that <hi>Will</hi> be fed, then Careleſneſs cometh up, and they fall into Flatneſs (from the Spirit) and are mindleſs of the Lord God; ſuch are ſoon up and down.

For whatſoever is ſeen with a Carnal Eye, is Carnal: See, if ye do find ſomething in your Underſtandings made manifeſt, which is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> to guide your Minds out of all <hi>External things,</hi> which wither away, and fade. For the <hi>Croſs</hi> is to the Carnal Mind; your (Carnal) Minds going into the Carnal and Earthly things, or your Eyes and Luſts into the Earth, where Lightneſs, Raſhneſs, Croſneſs, Bitterneſs and Preſumption is, then the <hi>Tongae</hi> will run at random, and is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and he that hath not Power over his own <hi>Tongue,</hi> his <hi>Religion</hi> is vain, and the light Mind ruleth.

               <p>Therefore give not way to your <hi>Wills,</hi> nor buſie your ſelves nor Minds with needleſs and careleſs Words, or ſuch things, for they will vail you, and draw your Minds from God: But keep within.

                  <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>Lo there</hi> is Chriſt, go not forth; for Chriſt is within you: And they are <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>Anti-Chriſts,</hi> which draw your Minds out from the Teaching, within you.

The true <hi>Church</hi> (the <hi>Saints</hi>) is in <hi>God;</hi> but the Imitation of the Church is in the World, without God.

               <p>Therefore <hi>lay aſide all Filthineſs and Superfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> and fear God, and give Glory to him, and worſhip not the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> for the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> muſt be caſt into the Lake of Fire.

For the <hi>Figures</hi> did Type forth the Subſtance; when the <hi>Subſtance</hi> was come, the <hi>Figures</hi> were taken away, and Types were ended. And the <hi>(falſe)</hi> Imitations of Chriſt and of God are in the World; and the <hi>vain</hi> Worſhips of the World are the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the Beaſt, and are not of God.

And that Mind may talk of God, and ſpeak of God, but not in Union with God, nor from Enjoyment of God in the Spirit, nor from having purchaſed the Knowledge of him through Death and Sufferings;<note place="margin">A Hear-ſay Knowledge.</note> but from <hi>Hear-ſay</hi> of him, and from Cuſtom and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which the true <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth deſtroy that Mind, which ſpeaks of him, but doth not live in his <hi>Fear:</hi> And that Mind

               <head>To Friends, concerning Judging.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FRiends</hi> to you all this is the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 48.</note> Take heed of <hi>Judging</hi> one another; <hi>Judge</hi> not one another (I charge you in the Preſence of the Lord) with that which muſt be Judged; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay open one anothers <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> behind one another's Backs; for thou that doſt ſo, art one of <hi>ham</hi>'s <hi>Family,</hi> which is under the <hi>Curſe.</hi> But every one of you in particular with the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which he hath enlightened you withal) ſee <hi>your ſelves,</hi> that <hi>Self</hi> may be <hi>Judged</hi> out with the <hi>Light</hi> in every one. Now,<note place="margin">Self Judged.</note> all loving the <hi>Light,</hi> here no <hi>Self</hi> can ſtand, but it is <hi>Judged</hi> with the <hi>Light;</hi> and here all are in Unity, and here no <hi>Self-will</hi> can ariſe, nor no <hi>Maſtery;</hi> but all that is <hi>Judged</hi> out. And let there be no <hi>Back-biting</hi> amongſt you; but in Love, ye that dwell in the Light, and ſee clear, ſpeak to the others, whoſe Minds are gone from the Light: Elſe (as I ſaid before) if ye do ſpeak behind their backs, there will be the <hi>Evil Eye</hi> and <hi>Filthy Mind,</hi> which dare not ſpeak to their Faces. And ſo the ſame <hi>(Mind)</hi> which doth condemn behind the back, is for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and ſo <hi>Self</hi> ſhould be <hi>Judged</hi> firſt. Here ye will be kept watchful ub the pure <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and all <hi>Self</hi> will be <hi>Judged</hi> out from amongſt you, which would be <hi>Judging</hi> in ſecret; which is a <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And take heed (I charge you all in the Preſence of the Living God) of a <hi>feigned Humility,</hi> and a <hi>feigned Love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Feigned Love and Humility.</note> which is out of the <hi>Light,</hi> and then that to uſe as a Cuſtomary <hi>Salutation,</hi> or a Formal <hi>Geſture;</hi> which is all for Condemnation, and to be kept out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Covenant. So ſee, that all your <hi>Actings</hi> be in and from the <hi>Light;</hi> here ye will be kept clean and pure, and will come to be ſealed in the Everlaſting Covenant of God with the <hi>Light, which comes from Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, I charge you all in the Prefence of the Living God, not to ſuffer your Minds to go out to <hi>Contend</hi> with them,<note place="margin">Contentions out of Truth.</note> who be not of the <hi>Truth,</hi> in that which is out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> both which are to be condemned with the <hi>Truth.</hi> For the ſame Mind will <hi>boaſt</hi> and get up, which is out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and reaches at things in the <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,</hi> though it lives not in it, but is excluded out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſhall not enter; but is for Condemnation. And ſo to you all this is the <hi>Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Lord God</hi> of Power and of Peace, that in <hi>Peace</hi> ye may be preſerved, to wait for the Spirit of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Friends all every where, Meet together,</hi> waiting upon the Lord, that your Minds may be guided by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> up to God. And know the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in one another, which all, whoſe Minds are abroad, are Strangers to, and to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Promiſe;</hi> for the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> is with and to the Seed:<note place="margin">The Covenant and Promiſe of Life.</note> And there is no <hi>Sin, Iniquity</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> in the Covenant; for that is all <hi>Judged,</hi> being out of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore all wait, that ye all may come to witneſs the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> made with your Souls, and to find the Witneſs, the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that ye are <hi>Sealed</hi> to God with,<note place="margin">Sin and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion finiſh'd.</note> and that ye may all witneſs <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> finiſhed, and blotted out by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the New <hi>Covenant</hi> of

                  <hi>God;</hi> and ye may all come to know the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to love the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt hath given you, to teach you; then ye will witneſs the <hi>Covenant,</hi> yea <hi>Ten Thouſands</hi> will witneſs the <hi>Covenant, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For as the Lord ſaid, <hi>I will give him for a Covenant of Light to the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes;</hi> And ſo, this <hi>Light</hi> doth open the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>blind.</hi> All ye, that were <hi>blind,</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> ye know, that with the <hi>Light</hi> your <hi>Eyes</hi> are opened, and ye do ſee the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the Unchangable Prieſt, the Unchangable Covenant. So in that, which changeth not, dwell, that that which is changable and wavering, may be Judged and Condemned with that which changeth not. And though the <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> was and is glorious in its time,<note place="margin">The Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit.</note> yet the <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in Glory, which changeth not; and there is no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, who are in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> who walk in the Spirit. But who are in that which changeth, running into the <hi>Changable</hi> Ways and Works without, and are in that Nature which hates the <hi>Light,</hi> all ſuch are for Condemnation by the <hi>Light,</hi> which is <hi>Eternal,</hi> and never changeth. And all the beggarly <hi>Luſts, Traditions</hi> and <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Men, which are acted in that Nature, contrary to the <hi>Light,</hi> are for Condemnation by the <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, dwelling all in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangable,</hi> ye come to Judge all the <hi>Changable</hi> Ways and Worſhips,<note place="margin">Changable Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</note> that are <hi>Variable</hi> and <hi>Changable,</hi> by that which comes from God, which changeth not; and with his <hi>Light,</hi> which he hath given, all thoſe things are Judged. So dwelling in the <hi>Judgment,</hi> ye will be filled full of <hi>Mercy;</hi> for firſt <hi>Judgment,</hi> and then <hi>Mercy</hi> is to ſpread over all, that the <hi>Juſt</hi> may rule over all.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> I charge you all in the Preſence of the Living God, let no <hi>Evil Communication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Evil Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> nor evil Words proceed out of your Mouths. And if ye find the <hi>Root</hi> in you not taken away, that would act ſuch things, dwell in the <hi>Light,</hi> which lets you ſee the <hi>Evil Communications,</hi> and with the <hi>Light</hi> give <hi>Judgment</hi> upon it in the particular, and firſt Judge it there; for that is it, which corrupts the <hi>Good Manners.</hi> And there areno <hi>good Manners,</hi> but all is corrupted, whilſt there is <hi>Evil Communication,</hi> and all that Profeſſion is Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord, whilſt that ſtands. So, put away all <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communication</hi> out of your Mouths, and all <hi>Wrath, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and <hi>

               <p>So, all walk in the <hi>Light,</hi> with which ye are enlightned, for it will teach you all the <hi>good Manners</hi> and <hi>pure Communication,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Good Manners.</note> and condemn all corrupt Manners and corrupt Communication; and ſo to have the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> cleanſed from all ſuch things. And all walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

So the <hi>Light</hi> is the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the Condemnation; and in the <hi>Light</hi> walk, and ye will ſhine.</p>

Ye that dwell in the <hi>Light,</hi> and walk in the <hi>Light,</hi> uſe <hi>Plainneſs</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> and plain <hi>Words,</hi> ſingle <hi>Words</hi> in the ſingle Life, pure <hi>Words</hi> from the pure Life, ſeaſoned <hi>Words,</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with <hi>Grace,</hi> which teacheth to deny all Ungodlineſs and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts.

Therefore <hi>Friends,</hi> in <hi>Plainneſs</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> all dwell; for dwelling in the <hi>Light,</hi> it will bring you to <hi>Plainneſs</hi> and <hi>few Words,</hi> to live in the <hi>Life,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> is in that, which condemns the World. And all who live in their own <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>yet</hi> make a Profeſſion of the Scriptures, there are the <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi>

So, dwell all in the Eternal Power of God, and in his pure <hi>Light,</hi> that ye may be a Terror to all Evil-doers, and to all Ungodlineſs, and to all who act Unrighteouſly, and live in Uncleanneſs.

And all who are out of <hi>Plainneſs,</hi> with the Eternal <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt hath enlightned them withal, ſhall they be condemned and confounded in <hi>Time:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Light was before Time.</note> (For this <hi>Light</hi> was before <hi>Time,</hi> and is in <hi>Time,</hi> which lets every Man and Woman ſee all their Actions done in <hi>Time;</hi> and hating this <hi>Light,</hi> this is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.) But all loving this <hi>Light,</hi> and walking in this <hi>Light,</hi> ye will come to walk in that, which is the World's Condemnation; and it will bring you to ſee the World to be gone from God, from Chriſt, and all who are of God. And this is the <hi>Counſel</hi> of God to you, that in that, which is contrary to your <hi>Fleſhly Wills,</hi> ye may all wait and walk, for that will lead you from all <hi>vain Thoughts,</hi> and all <hi>evil Deſires;</hi> there wait, and ye will witneſs the <hi>Birth</hi> born, not by the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> And this <hi>Birth</hi> is <hi>Heir</hi> of another World, and <hi>Heir</hi> of the certain Riches, which is manifeſt to <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. So to you all this is a Warning from the Lord, who are in the <hi>Light,</hi> and love the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned you withal, which is contrary to your <hi>Wills,</hi> and all Mens <hi>Wills;</hi> that with it ye may uſe <hi>plainneſs</hi> of <hi>Speech</hi> to all, and ſo to be made manifeſt to that, which they hate, which is their Condemnation, the <hi>Light.</hi> And abiding in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

                  <hi>This was I moved of the Lord to ſend out abroad among you, as a Meſſage to all the</hi> Plants <hi>of the</hi> Lord.</p>
               <p>If ye ſpeak any thing contrary to the <hi>Light,</hi> which Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned you withal, with the <hi>Light</hi> ye are to be condemned.

Or if he ask a Fiſh, will he for a Fiſh give him a Serpent? Or if he, ſhall ask an Egg, will he give him a Scorpion? If ye then being Evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> And further he encourages to <hi>Pray,</hi> Luke 18. <hi>He ſpake a Parable unto them, that Men ought always to pray, and not faint, ſaying: There was in a City a Judge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt. Judge.</note> 
                  <hi>that feared not God, neither regarded Man. And there was a Widow in that City, and ſhe came to him, and ſaid, Avenge me of mine Adverſary; and he would not for a while. But afterwards he ſaid within himſelf, Though I fear not God, nor regard Man; yet becauſe this Widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, leſt by her continual coming ſhe weary me. And the Lord ſaid, Hear what the unjuſt Judge ſaith; And ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him, tho' he bear long with them? I tell you, that he will avenge them ſpeedily.</hi> Here mind the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that doth not change, but will be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt diſtinguiſhes in a Parable of a <hi>Phariſee</hi> (who was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>praying Man</hi>) and of a <hi>Publican,</hi>

               <p>And this <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which hath given this <hi>Judgment</hi> ſo upon <hi>Friends,</hi> and amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> not only in a <hi>Paper</hi> to be ſpread up and down, but alſo in <hi>Diſputes</hi> and <hi>Jangligns</hi> about it; in which is ſuch a <hi>Judgment</hi> contrary to <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> comely <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which was ſet up amongſ them. This <hi>Judgment,</hi> hath not only judged us, but alſo the Apoſtle: They may as well ſay, He ſet up a <hi>Form</hi> in the <hi>Curſe, Ignorance, Heatheniſh</hi> and <hi>Romiſh;</hi> who calls it, a <hi>comely thing for a Man to pray uncovered, if not,<note place="margin">Praying and Propheſying.</note> he diſhonours his <hi>Head;</hi> and a <hi>Comely thing</hi> for a Woman to pray or propheſie with her Head covered: So there was a <hi>Comelineſs</hi> and an <hi>Honour</hi> in it. We never uſe to preach up ſuch things, who are come to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Coverings</hi> or <hi>Hats</hi> were. And many would not have believed, that ever ſuch things would have come forth amongſt us; but now they ſee our <hi>Comely Order</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> is likened to a <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Order,</hi> and curſt. Some ſuch the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had to do withal, when he ſet up his comely Order,</hi> before the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Way was.</p>

For they that have <hi>attained</hi> to that State, which <hi>Adam</hi> was in before the Fall, it is without <hi>Hats</hi> or <hi>Coverings.</hi> And they that are come to Chriſt (and abide in him) are in a State beyond <hi>Adam,</hi> before he fell,<note place="margin">The State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore outward <hi>Coverings</hi> were; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was with the <hi>Father,</hi> before the World began, before <hi>Adam</hi> was made. And when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> how that he would have them to know, that <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Man</hi> was the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Woman;</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> was made for the <hi>Man,</hi> and not the <hi>Man</hi> for the <hi>Woman;</hi> and he is the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and ſhe is the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Man.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſpake to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were not come to the State of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> before they fell; amongſt whom there was a <hi>Sect</hi> about the <hi>Man</hi> being <hi>covered,</hi> and the <hi>Woman uncovered.</hi> Amongſt whom he ſets up a <hi>Comely Order</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and lets them ſee, how they ſhould <hi>pray, propheſie</hi> and <hi>practiſe.</hi> So he meant there of outward things,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96751:82"/>when he ſpeaks of a <hi>Man uncovered,</hi> and a <hi>Woman covered;</hi> or elſe he ſhould be ſhaven and ſhorn.

And ſo here's a clear diſtinction to you, that you may know what leads to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and what luſts to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy;</hi> for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> does not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute any that does not receive that which he ſets up; but the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> doth perſecute them that will not receive that which it ſets up: And in this you may try both <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> (as the <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> devoured up all the <hi>Magicians Serpents</hi>) of the <hi>Lying Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders;</hi> ſo ſhall the <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who has all the <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> given unto him, who will rule all <hi>Nations</hi> with his <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iron.

               <p>So remember <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Three Children,</hi> though <hi>Priſoners,</hi> yet could not bow to the <hi>National Worſhip,</hi> and ſo were caſt into the <hi>Fiery Furnace,</hi> and the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> unto whom the <hi>Lord God</hi> gave <hi>Dominion</hi> over their <hi>Enemies,</hi> and confounded the <hi>National Worſhippers,</hi> with all the <hi>Magicians,</hi> and made the <hi>King</hi> to change his <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi> And this was in the <hi>Babyloniſh Monarchy;</hi> and when the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> got up, the Power was changed, then they caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> becauſe he prayed to his God contrary to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Decree,</hi> to whom God appeared again and confounded them all, and made the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Emperor</hi> to change his <hi>Decree.</hi> Therefore keep <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for that is it by which the <hi>Elders</hi> of old obtained a <hi>good Report.</hi> And conſider <hi>Mordecay,</hi> who ſtood faithful, and could not bow to proud <hi>Fleſh,</hi> though it was in danger of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>Jews,</hi> over whom, through Obedience to God, he gave him Victory, by which he came to anſwer the <hi>Good</hi> in all <hi>People.</hi> Now conſider, they that came to profefs <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> before the <hi>Types, Figures</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> which were held up by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> (which Chriſt the Subſtance came to end) how that I ſay, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of <hi>Old</hi> by that kind of People, the <hi>Jews,</hi> as you do now ſuffer the moſt, and have done by them that are the greateſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Words, but out of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Chriſt, which the Apoſtles and Saints were in, in the <hi>Primitive Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is no new thing, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Here is no new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun;</hi> for it is not a new thing for the <hi>Birth</hi> that is born after the <hi>Fleſh</hi> to perſecute the <hi>Birth</hi> that is born after the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And look upon the Apoſtles, and conſider how they ſuffered (and by whom) that bore <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to the <hi>Subſtance;</hi> their Sufferings were by ſuch as were in the <hi>Husks, Shadows, Inventions</hi> and <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſuch as were fallen from <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Righteouſneſs, Image</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and not in the renewed <hi>State.</hi> And conſider how that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſuffered the ſpoiling of their Goods by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who were called <hi>Jews,</hi> as you may read in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> for ye read in few of the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſuffered the ſpoiling of their Goods (or the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) but moſtly by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the great Profeſſors, as you do and have done in theſe Days.</p>
               <p>And conſider how the <hi>Witneſs</hi> hath been ſlain, and (the <hi>true Church</hi>) the <hi>Woman</hi> fled into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> who was perſecuted; and how ſhe hath been fed there of God; and how ſince that time the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi>'s Worſhip hath been up, and the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> (the <hi>falſe Church</hi>) which hath riden on the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>'s Power, whom the People have Worſhipped; who hath cauſed all <hi>Nations</hi> to drink of the <hi>Whore</hi>'s <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Fornication.</hi> Now you that have come to the end, and beyond all the <hi>Worſhips</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and after the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who comes now to fathom the <hi>Whore</hi> (the <hi>fale Church</hi>) and the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and comes to ſee the <hi>Power,</hi> and to be in it, that takes them and and caſts them alive into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> (which hath been Worſhipped) and burns the <hi>Whore</hi>'s Fleſh

Now the <hi>Dragon</hi>'s <hi>Worſhip, Beaſt, falſe Church, falſe Prophet</hi> is taken, the old <hi>Dragon</hi> caſt into the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> (and with him the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi>) and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of the <hi>Whore</hi> burnt: <hi>Reap out, reap out, reap out</hi> I ſay (with the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) ye <hi>Reapers</hi> unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> for here is the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Harveſt,</hi> for as the other falls, the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Harveſt</hi> is known, a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Gathering;</hi> for it is that which hat inwardly Ravened, that hath ſcattered.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96751:113"/>that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all their <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> are in, in the Fall; where, in that State, they glory in the Creaturcs, and in their Shame, and in their Inventions, or in their Strength, Wiſdom or Riches: But glorying in the Croſs of Chriſt, the Power of God, the glorying is in that which doth Crucifie from the State of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all their <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> in the <hi>Fall;</hi> and from this State all the <hi>Apoſtate-Chriſtians</hi> are ſince the Apoſtles Days: And in this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is Everlaſting Glorying; which is a Croſs to all that live (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and in the <hi>Fall;</hi> but not a Croſs to them that be Redeemed and Crucified; for their glorying ſtands in it which is over all the gloryings in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and all Creatures. So in the <hi>Power</hi> of the Lord God meet, wait, live, and dwell, and have fellowſhip; for in the <hi>Power, Chriſt</hi> lives: Therefore now you that are come to know the <hi>Goſpel</hi> preached again which was amongſt the Apoſtles, in this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> you will feel before the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> where all things were good and bleſt in the <hi>Beginning</hi> before the <hi>Fall;</hi> which, after the <hi>Fall,</hi> the Curſe came, which buought the <hi>Woe</hi> and <hi>Miſery:</hi> So you that feel the Redemption out of the <hi>Fall,</hi> you know the State of the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> before the <hi>Fall,</hi> how all things were good and bleſſed: Come into the ſame <hi>Power</hi> that brings you up before the <hi>Fall,</hi> and brings you to be gathered in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is above every <hi>Name,</hi> and be gathered into the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by which <hi>Salvation</hi> is brought; for there is no other <hi>Name</hi> under <hi>Heaven</hi> given, by which <hi>Salvation</hi> is brought, but by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> So, ye being gathered in the <hi>Name</hi> which is above every Name, and alſo in the <hi>Name</hi> by which <hi>Salvation</hi> is brought, and by no other Name; in that wait, and meet, and keep together; ſo ye will feel the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> in you, and amongſt you.

And alſo what jangling was there in the Church in the <hi>Primitive Times</hi> about <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> brings them off, and tells them, That <hi>Circumciſion nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion availeth nothing, but a new Creature.</hi> Therefore mind that New Creature, and the <hi>Faith</hi> that works by <hi>Love.</hi> And how alſo there was <hi>Janglings</hi> about <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:96751:114"/>and the <hi>Supper,</hi> and about <hi>Men,</hi> ſome for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. But the Apoſtle directed them all to know <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Seed,</hi> in the Male and Female, and told them he preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, and bid them examine themſelves, and prove themſelves, and to know him to be in them, otherwiſe they were <hi>Reprobates;</hi> and he brings them off from things that are ſeen, for the things which are ſeen are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but the things that are not ſeen are Eternal. Now theſe things which they jangled about, were things that were ſeen, and not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, but Temporal; for, if they did not come to Chriſt Jeſus, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of thoſe things, they remained in the <hi>Reprobation</hi> from the <hi>Life, Truth</hi> and <hi>Subſtance.</hi> And alſo what <hi>Janglings</hi> there was amongſt the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> about <hi>Marriage</hi> of Believers, and Unbelievers, and the departing of the Believers from the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; which the Apoſtle told them, That <hi>Marriage</hi> was honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled; and how that they ſhould abide toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Believer with the Unbeliever; and how that the Believer ſanctifieth the Unbeliever, by which their Children were not unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but clean; and how it <hi>was better to marry than to burn;</hi> though he ſpake to the ſame <hi>Corinthians</hi> of a State which was beyond that. And likewiſe, alſo how there was <hi>Janglings</hi> about <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> about ſuch as transformed themſelves as into <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and ſuch as preached for <hi>filthy Lucre,</hi> and ſuch as ſerved not the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but their own Bellies; which the Apoſtle ſtops all ſuch, and brings them to the <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Seed,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> over them all; and ſhews concerning <hi>Marriage,</hi> how <hi>God</hi> made them Male and Female in the <hi>Beginning;</hi> which was the honourable <hi>Marriage</hi> before the defiled State was.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe what <hi>Janglings</hi> there was, whether the Woman ſhould be <hi>covered,</hi> or the Man ſhould be <hi>covered,</hi> when they Prayed or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phefied; in which the Apoſtle ſet forth a Comlineſs among them, of the Man's being <hi>uncovered,</hi> and the Woman <hi>covered;</hi> in as much as the Man was the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the Woman the glory of the Man. Nevertheleſs, he would have them to know, that <hi>God</hi> was the Head of Chriſt, and Chriſt was the Head of the Man, and the Man was the Head of the Woman; and the Woman was made for the Man, and not the Man for the Woman. And thus ye may ſee that theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not come up to the State of <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell, and of <hi>Eve,</hi> by the Apoſtles ſetting thus forth their States: And whereas it is ſaid by ſome, <hi>That Chriſt is the Head of the Man,</hi> &amp;c. Which Head of Man (ſay they) is the ſame that is Head of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Mark,</hi> Now, if it be ſo, according to this Interpretation (which is wreſting) then Chriſt muſt be <hi>covered</hi> in the Woman, when ſhe Prays or Propheſies, and the Woman muſt have <hi>Power</hi> over Chriſt, and ſhe be <hi>uncovered,</hi> then Chriſt muſt be ſhorn or ſhaven; which is ridiculous, and ſhews then a difference of Chriſt in the Male and the Female; which is not ſo, for God is the Head of Chriſt, and Chriſt the Head of Man, as he was made, and Man the Head of the Woman: But as Woman received the <hi>Temptation,</hi> and likewiſe alſo the Man, and ſo are both in the <hi>Fall;</hi> now this was ſpoken as Man was made before he fell, which as Man comes up again out of the <hi>Fall,</hi> and Woman, Chriſt in the Male and in the Female he is Head of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96751:115"/>both. But now this was ſpoken to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (who were not come up to the State that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were in before they fell) among whom this difference about <hi>covering</hi> or <hi>uncovering</hi> was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Man ſhould be <hi>uncovered,</hi> and the Woman <hi>covered</hi> when they Prayed? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was the comely Order which the Apoſtle ſet amongſt them, and told them there ſhould be Hereſies among them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 19.</note> that they that were approved might be made manifeſt, and looked upon them as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who <hi>jangled</hi> contrary to his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Order and Practice, which was, as ſaid before, ſpoken to ſuch as were not come to the State of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> before they fell; for they that are come thither to that State by Chriſt, are come before out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coverings were; and them that are come to Chriſt, are come to the end of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to the Seed Chriſt, the <hi>Top-Stone,</hi> in whom all things end; which <hi>Top</hi> and <hi>Corner-Stone</hi> is over all that laid that Ends and Changes. So, let your <hi>Life</hi> be in that which never ends, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver changes, and in whom there is no changing nor altering: And who are come to this, will not go back again into outward things.

               <p>And ſo never heed the Wicked's Tempeſt, Storm, nor Hail, nor his Arrows nor Inſtruments of Cruelty; let nor the Back and the Hair, the Cheek and the Shoulder be ever turned from him; though many <hi>Weapons</hi> be formed againſt him and his followers, yet they ſhall never Proſper, for the Seed <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reign over all, and will ſtand when they are gone, which was before they were.</p>
               <p>And ſo be Faithful unto the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and be Valiant for his <hi>Truth</hi> upon <hi>Earth!</hi> Shewing that ſomething will oppoſe it, or elſe what need the word <hi>Valiant</hi> be ſpoken?

                     <hi>I.</hi> Concerning the Word of God, and the Original, what it is.</note> ſo where the <hi>Mind</hi> is ſtaid upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> there is a <hi>Perfect Peace;</hi> for it is a whole <hi>Peace,</hi> which cannot be broken: So here is not only a <hi>Perfect Peace,</hi> but a Bleſſing; a <hi>Perfect Peace</hi> which comes from the God of all <hi>Peace,</hi> (that bruiſeth the <hi>Serpent's</hi> Head under your Feet, the Troubler) and the Bleſſings which come from the bleſſed God.<note place="margin">Perfect Peace in God only, and not in the Creatures.</note> So all imperfect <hi>Peace</hi> may be broken, that is when the <hi>Mind</hi> is ſtaid upon the Creature, or in any Creature, and not upon the <hi>Creator;</hi> or in any outward Things, Goods, Houſes, Lands, or Inventions of Vanities, in the fooliſh vain Faſhions; which the Luſt of the <hi>Eye</hi> and the Pride of <hi>Life</hi> go into, which will defile and corrupt it. When any of theſe things fail, and are not according to your <hi>Mind,</hi> it being in them, then your <hi>Peace</hi> is broken, and you are croſs and brittle, and <hi>Envy</hi> gets up: So this is not a <hi>perfect Peace,</hi> but is a broken <hi>Peace,</hi> and then you have the <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and not the Bleſſing: And the Reaſon is, becauſe your <hi>Minds</hi> are in the Creatures, and the outward Things, and are not ſtaid upon the <hi>Creator,</hi> where the <hi>perfect Peace</hi> is, and the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> where nothing can get betwixt you and the Lord. And this is below <hi>Job,</hi> to have the <hi>Mind</hi> in the Creatures and viſible things; for when you are tried, and Creatures fail you, you are croſs'd and troubled; that ſhews an <hi>imperfect State;</hi> for God ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Job <hi>was a perfect Man:</hi> And when that the Lord ſuffered him to be tried, and when that his Goods and Houſes were thrown down, and driven away, and Servants killed, he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord; for the Lord gave, and the Lord taketh:</hi> Here his <hi>Mind</hi> was ſtaied upon the <hi>Lord,</hi> and he retained his <hi>Peace.</hi> And when that his Children were deſtroyed, and his Wife ſaid to him, <hi>What, doſt thou ſtill retain thy Integrity? Curſe God and die;</hi> he rebukes her, and calls her, <hi>A fooliſh Woman;</hi> and ſaid unto her, <hi>Shall I receive good of the Lord, and not evill?

Now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, who think your ſelves high, and above <hi>Job,</hi> if that your Goods and Children ſhould be after the ſame manner taken away (whoſe <hi>Minds</hi> are in them) you would be found in a troubled brickle State, far below <hi>Job.</hi> And when that <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends came to reaſon with him, who kept his Integrity, and would no way yield to them, they counted him an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He reſtrained Prayer, and filled his Belly with Eaſt-wind;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>What, ſhall mortal Man be more pure than his Maker?

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96751:122"/>chargeth his Angels with Folly, and the Heavens are not clear in his Sight.</hi> And theſe are the Scriptures the Prieſts uſe to bring againſt Friends (who keep their Integrity) as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did againſt him: But at the laſt the Lord commanded <hi>Job</hi> to offer a Sacrifice for his Friends, becauſe they had ſinned, and ſpoken not right, as <hi>Job</hi> had, who was <hi>Perfect</hi> and kept his <hi>Integrity.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaid to the Saints, <hi>That he had learned in all Conditions to be content.

               <p>And this was the <hi>Word</hi> that came to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> by which he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Preaching,</hi> and of his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and by which <hi>Word</hi> he reproved the Shepherds, which were <hi>as greedy dumb Doggs, that could never have enough, ſeeking their Gain from their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> And by this <hi>Word</hi> he ſaw, <hi>that all the Children of God ſhould be taught of God, and be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs and Peace;</hi> and though many Tongues ſhould riſe up in Judgment againſt them, yet thoſe that were taught of God ſhould condemn them all; ſuch <hi>Power</hi> ſhould be given to his Children.

               <p>And this was the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that made <hi>Jeremiah</hi> a Prophet, by which he ſaw the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> by which <hi>Word</hi> he was ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the People and the Princes, of the <hi>filthy and horrible thing committed in the Land, that the Prieſts preached for Hire, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

               <p>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> by this <hi>Word</hi> was made a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and by the <hi>Word</hi> reproved <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> for their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Worſhipping</hi> of <hi>Images:</hi> For which <hi>Word</hi>'s ſake they perſecuted him, and the reſt of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> and was not he fed of the <hi>Ravens</hi> by the <hi>River?</hi> And did they not ſeek to take away his <hi>Life?</hi> And did not he think all the <hi>Lord's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> had been killed, and he left alone; yet did not the <hi>Lord</hi> ſay to him, <hi>He had reſerved Seven Thouſand that had not bowed the Knee to</hi> Baal?

               <p>And by this <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Ezekiel</hi> made a <hi>Prophet;</hi> by which <hi>Word</hi> he reproved the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that made a Prey upon the People, and Taught them for the Fleece: And by the <hi>Word</hi> he ſaw that God would bring the People from under them, that they ſhould be made a Prey upon no longer; and would gather them from their Mouths, and ſet one <hi>Shepherd</hi> over them, even <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who is witneſſed) and by the <hi>Word</hi> he reproved the falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> that taught for handfuls of <hi>Barley,</hi> and pieces of <hi>Bread,</hi> and daubed with <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And by this <hi>Word Daniel</hi> was made a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and how the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould take his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> And by the <hi>Word</hi> he ſaw ſuch that ſhould riſe up againſt the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And by the <hi>Word</hi> he numbred the Years of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his time, <hi>Four Hundred Ninety Nine</hi> Years, and of his <hi>Death,</hi> and how he ſhould end the <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> and how that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould bring up <hi>Everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and put an end to <hi>Sin,</hi> and end their <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſeal up their <hi>Viſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Micah</hi> made a <hi>Prophet,</hi> by which he cried againſt the <hi>Prieſts that preached for Hire, and the Prophets that propheſied for Money, and the Judges that judged for Rewards, and ſuch as preached Peace to the People that put in their Mouths</hi> (like the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in theſe times) <hi>and when they did not, they prepared War againſt them, and chop'd their Fleſh, and broke their Bones:</hi> But <hi>Micah</hi> ſaw by the <hi>Word,</hi> that the Sun was gone down upon ſuch <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and they ſhould have no <hi>Viſion</hi> nor <hi>Anſwer</hi> from God.

But <hi>(Mark) Free-Men</hi> and <hi>Free-Women.</hi> And what hath made them <hi>Free-Men,</hi> and <hi>Free-Women,</hi> but <hi>Truth?</hi> For, if the <hi>Truth</hi> hath made you free, then are you free indeed.

And they that walk in this <hi>Way of Holineſs, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs; and Sorrow and Sighing ſhall flee away: And all that walk in this <hi>Way of Holineſs,</hi> their deaf Ear is unſtopped, and their blind Eye is opened. And the lame Man here ſhall leap as an Hart,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96751:134"/>and the dumb Man's Yongue ſhall ſing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1667"/> And here he ſhall ſee Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters guſh out of the Rock, and Streams out of the Deſart, in this <hi>Way of Holineſs:</hi> And here he ſhall ſee in this <hi>Way</hi> the patched Ground become a Pool, and the thirſty Land full of Springs; and in the Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, where Dragons lay, ſhall be Graſs with Reeds and Ruſhes, which begins to ſpring: Glory be to the Lord for ever. And this <hi>Way of Holineſs,</hi> which the Prophets propheſied of, is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> who ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the Way;</hi> and he is over all the <hi>fallen Ways,</hi> and before the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> glorified with <hi>Father,</hi> before the World began: And this is the <hi>Way</hi> of the way-faring Men, who have been way-faring up and down from Religion to Religion, from Worſhip to Worſhip, from one People to another, from one Miniſter and Teacher to another, and could not ſit down in any of their Ways, but way-fared, travelled and ſought: And now, Glory be to the <hi>Lord</hi> for ever, <hi>Thouſands</hi> of theſe way-faring Men are come to find their <hi>Way, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (and though Fools) yet <hi>ſhall not err therein;</hi> that is, they ſhall not err in their <hi>Way:</hi> They ſhall not err in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> for there is no Error in him, for he was before Error was; for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> the Ground of all Error. So, though they be called <hi>Fools</hi> (theſe way-faring Men) by all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> that are ſet down in their own <hi>Rudiments,</hi> and have perſecuted theſe way-faring Men as Fools, becauſe they would not ſit down with them in their <hi>Rudiments, Worſhips, Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>National Church,</hi> which <hi>National Powers</hi> have eſtabliſhed; yet thoſe way-faring Men walk on in their <hi>Way, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (where tho' Fools) yet they ſhall not err in the <hi>Way, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> though they be called <hi>Fools</hi> by all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> who are in their own <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Rudiments;</hi> yet thoſe Fools ſhall not err in the <hi>Way, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> though counted Fools for <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſake. And they ſee how all the wiſe Men in old <hi>Adam</hi> mixed with the Wiſdom of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> how they are all in their own Ways, Worſhips and Religions; and all the <hi>Sects</hi> in it, how they are like Tradeſmen, plucking from one Church to another, and getting Cuſtomers, and drawing People from one another's Church to their own Ways; and tearing one another to pieces, to get People from one another's Church to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſo are like Lions and ravenous Beaſts one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to get from one another's Church to maintain themſelves; and thus they ſeek the <hi>Peoples,</hi> not the People; and feed themſelves, and not the Flock; for they are out of the <hi>Way, Chriſt,</hi> and ſit down in their own Ways. But, for the way-faring Man, the <hi>Way of Holineſs</hi> is; for him, that is way-faring and ſeeking up and down for his beloved. <hi>I ſought my beloved by Night, and the Watch-men ſmote me.</hi> Did not the way-faring Man go to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and ſay, <hi>You Watch men of the Night, did ye ſee my Beloved?</hi> What is thy Beloved more than another's Beloved, <hi>ſaid they?</hi> What is thy Religion, more than another's Religion? Or, thy Profeſſion, more than another's Profeſſion? So the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſmote and wounded the way-faring Men. The way-faring Men did not ask the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for his Beloved; for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had a Beloved, a <hi>Maſs-Book;</hi> but he asked him for his own Beloved, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, the next Watch-men was the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Men of every Pariſh. The way-faring Men went to thoſe Watch-men of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96751:135"/>Night, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1668"/> and ſaid, <hi>Did ye ſee my Beloved?</hi> They ſtormed at the <hi>Way-faring Men,</hi> and ſaid, What is thy <hi>Beloved</hi> more than another's <hi>Beloved,</hi> and thy <hi>Religion</hi> more than another's <hi>Religion:</hi> They ſmote him, and wounded him alſo.</p>
               <p>Well, the next Watch-men of the Night were the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> they were alſo the Watch-men of ſome People, the Way-faring Men went to them, and ſaid, <hi>Ye</hi> Watch-men <hi>of the</hi> Night, <hi>did ye ſee my Boloved?</hi> And they were exceeding angry, and ſaid, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another's Beloved, and what is thy Religion more than another's Religion?</hi> He did not ask him for his <hi>Beloved;</hi> for he knew he had a <hi>Beloved,</hi> his <hi>Directory:</hi> And theſe Watch-men ſmote the Way-faring Men, and puniſhed ſome, ſpoiled ſome of their Goods, and killed ſome, (as ſome at <hi>New-England</hi>) becauſe they would not follow their <hi>Beloved,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and others had done before them.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Watch-men</hi> were the <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> the <hi>Way-faring Men</hi> went to them alſo; for they were the <hi>Watch-men</hi> of ſome People, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye Watch-men of the Night, did ye ſee my Beloved?</hi> And theſe <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night</hi> were alſo exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ſaid, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another's Beloved, and thy Way more than another's Way, and thy Religion more than another's:</hi> And theſe <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night</hi> ſmote cruelly.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Wayfaring Men</hi> went to the private <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſterians</hi> and ſeekers; and theſe <hi>Watch-men</hi> fell a <hi>Mocking,</hi> and <hi>Scoffing,</hi> and <hi>Railing,</hi> and <hi>Smiting</hi> with the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and thruſt them out of their <hi>Meetings:</hi> And when it was asked them, <hi>If they ſaw the Wayfaring Man's Beloved?</hi> And they ſcoffed at their <hi>Beloved.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Way-faring Men</hi> way-fared up and down from <hi>Watch-man</hi> to <hi>Watch-man</hi> to ſeek their <hi>Beloved;</hi> and many were impriſoned and perſecuted by ſome of theſe <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night.</hi> And now <hi>Glory</hi> for ever be to the <hi>Lord,</hi> Thouſands of theſe <hi>Way-faring Men</hi> have found their <hi>Beloved,</hi> and have found their <hi>Way, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and a <hi>Fool ſhall not err therein;</hi> for there is no Error in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> all the Error is out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Way,</hi> wherein the <hi>Way-faring Men, tho' counted Fools, yet ſhall not err.</hi> And now <hi>my Beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> we are come to the <hi>Banquetting Houſe,</hi> and his <hi>Banner</hi> over us is <hi>Love.</hi> And the <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night</hi> told the <hi>Way-faring Men,</hi> That there was not any <hi>Way,</hi> but there was Error in it; and that all the <hi>Religions,</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> erred.

               <p>And did not you <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night</hi> tell the <hi>Way-faring Men,</hi> That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were not truly Tranſlated that ſpeaks of a <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and a <hi>Way that the Way-faring Men, though Fools, ſhould not err therein?</hi> For ye <hi>Watch-men</hi> of the <hi>Night</hi> could not ſee this <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Holineſs:</hi> For, do you not ſay, that a <hi>Fool</hi> will Err in every thing he doth?

               <p>The Outward <hi>Jew</hi> worſhipped in his outward <hi>Temple</hi> made with Hands, at Outward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concerning the Worſhip of God that Chriſt ſet up above <hi>1600</hi> Years ſince; and concerning the Worſhip of the <hi>Jews</hi> before.</note> and they came up Yearly to Worſhip there; and if they did not come up to Worſhip at outward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and keep the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> upon them ſhould be no Rain; and their Eyes were to rot out of their Heads, and their Tongues out of their Mouths, that fought againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in <hi>Zachary</hi> 14.12. So the outward <hi>Jew</hi> had but one <hi>Temple</hi> in the whole World, and there they went to Worſhip in it; and the <hi>Prieſt</hi> had a Chamber in the <hi>Temple.</hi> And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, he ended the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> he ended the <hi>Offerings,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> and the Worſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of the outward <hi>Jews;</hi> and ſet up another Worſhip in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth:</hi> For when the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that came to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, ſaid unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> How that <hi>our Father's Worſhipped in this Mountain,</hi> where <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well was, and the Well was made before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, or the <hi>Temple</hi> either; for <hi>Jacob</hi> died in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after him his <hi>Sons</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and builded a <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo there they ſet up a place of Worſhip after the Well was made: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid unto the Woman, <hi>The Hour is coming, and now is, that they that Worſhip the Father muſt Worſhip him in Spirit and Truth;</hi> and not at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor at this <hi>Mountain</hi> is God worſhipped; <hi>For God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in the Spirit and in the Truth:</hi> And then did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſet up his Worſhip, which was before the <hi>Popes, Turks, Common-Prayer, Presbyterian, Independant,</hi> and other Worſhips were, and the Worſhip that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſet up, was in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth.</hi> Now where is this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and where is this <hi>Truth?</hi> Is it not within People? So as the Jew outward was to Worſhip in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and there was but that one <hi>Temple</hi> commanded of God to be built, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to end, who ſet up his Worſhip in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth.</hi> So ſeeing the true Worſhip is in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> is within you, in the inward parts, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is within you; you muſt not grieve, vex nor quench it. And ſo every Man and Woman in the whole World muſt come to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts, by which they muſt know the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to feel the <hi>Spirit</hi> in their own Hearts, and in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to Worſhip the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> who is a <hi>Spirit.</hi>

               <p>So now, as the <hi>Jew</hi> outward was to offer his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the outward Temple, and no where elſe, which Temple is now thrown down, he is not a <hi>Jew</hi> who is one outward, but he is a <hi>Jew</hi> who is one inward, in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſo, all ye <hi>Jews</hi> inward, in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ye muſt worſhip in the <hi>Truth</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And ſo, the <hi>Jew</hi> inward can worſhip no where but in the Temple. What Temple? It is not a Temple that is made with Hands. The Jews outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in the Temple that was made with Hands; but the Jew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his worſhip is to be in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not made with Hands. So to worſhip in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>Truth,</hi> is to worſhip in the Temple, and no where elſe. And ſo, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man and Woman in the whole World muſt worſhip in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. What Temple? The Temple that is not made with Hands. Where the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> is. Know ye not, <hi>that your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> And ſo, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man and Woman muſt be brought to <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts, and brought to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Hearts. This is the ſtanding and perfect Worſhip, and it will ſtand when all the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of old <hi>Adam</hi> are gone, and when the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Worſhips, that be not in the <hi>Truth,</hi> are gone: For this is a ſtanding and perfect Worſhip; the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is Perfect. And this is an Univerſal Worſhip, and brings every individual Man and Woman to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Hearts. This makes no <hi>Sect,</hi> but every one in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> is in the <hi>Truth,</hi> which the <hi>Enmity</hi> is out of: And this Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Man,</hi> which the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> from Heaven ſet up above <hi>Sixteen hundred</hi> Years ſince. And ſo, every one is to be in it, and to walk in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to come to the <hi>Truth</hi> in their own particulars. For that <hi>Spirit</hi> makes <hi>Sects,</hi> which perſecutes People for not following them; but they are all to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in that Spiritual Worſhip, which <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſet up; and every <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> is to come to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in their own Hearts; and ſo in that <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> to Worſhip the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> who is a <hi>Spirit;</hi> for he ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip him. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſecuted none for not following his Worſhip; but all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in their own ſelves, who grieves it, and vexes and quenches it, and all are Condemned with the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> that hate it, who will not come to it, but hate it. So they all that Perſecute about <hi>Religion</hi> run into <hi>Heaps,</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and are with the <hi>Light</hi> condemned. And ſo none can Worſhip the God of <hi>Truth,</hi> but who comes to the <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts; and none can Worſhip <hi>God,</hi> who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> but who comes to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Hearts, which mortifies <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> which <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> leads into all <hi>Truth:</hi> So every one who is a Jew inward muſt Worſhip in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and every one muſt be brought to the <hi>Temple</hi> which is not made with Hands, and to Worſhip in the <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſet up, who is the <hi>Spiritual Man.</hi> Carnal Men may ſet up Worſhips, who have not the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had. And ſuch leads People into <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Heaps,</hi> and leads People out of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and perſecutes one another about their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96751:136"/>Worſhips, which is not the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> nor the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but on the contrary, <hi>to love one another.</hi> So all that Worſhip in the Spirit and Truth, comes to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts, and loves one another, and loves Enemies. And ſo as the outward <hi>Jews</hi> Prieſts had Chambers in the <hi>Temple;</hi> which <hi>Prieſts, Chambers</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> Chriſt hath ended. So let <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> now have a <hi>Chamber</hi> in your <hi>Temple,</hi> to ſanctifie your <hi>Temple,</hi> and cleanſe your <hi>Temple,</hi> that the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> may fill your <hi>Temple:</hi> The <hi>Jews Prieſts</hi> were to cleanſe the <hi>Temple,</hi> and when they had caſt the Rubbiſh out of it, the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> filled their <hi>Temple:</hi> And ſo <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hath ended the <hi>Jews Prieſts</hi> Chambers and Temple. And ſo all ye who are <hi>Jews</hi> inward in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> let <hi>Chriſt</hi> your <hi>Prieſt</hi> have a Chamber in your Temple, that he may cleanſe your <hi>Temple,</hi> and caſt the Rubbiſh out of it, which is come in by Tranſgreſſion, who doth renew you up into the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were in before they fell; ſo that the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> may fill your <hi>Temple.</hi> And ſo as the <hi>Jew</hi> outward had but one <hi>Temple</hi> to Worſhip in, the <hi>Jew</hi> inward muſt not have two; for then they make a <hi>Sect,</hi> and goes from <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts, and from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And ſo to Worſhip in the <hi>Truth</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is to Worſhip in the Temple. So every Man and Woman come to this one <hi>Temple:</hi> Where is this one <hi>Temple?</hi> Where the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in the Heart, and the <hi>Truth</hi> in the inward Parts: And this is the <hi>Temple</hi> that is not made with Hands; do you not know <hi>that your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> And ſo this is the true Worſhip that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſet up, in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth;</hi> every Man and Woman in the whole World muſt come to it, the <hi>Truth</hi> in their own Hearts, that by it they may know the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> And by the <hi>Spirit</hi> they may know God, who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and ſo Worſhip him in the Spirit and in the Truth; and this is the ſtanding univerſal Worſhip, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Spirtual Man,</hi> ſet up above <hi>Sixteen hundred</hi> Years ſince; <hi>John</hi> 4. when he denied the <hi>Mountain Worſhip,</hi> where <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well was, and the Temple Worſhip of the outward <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they went to the outward <hi>Temple</hi> Yearly to Worſhip. And ſo every one are to <hi>Worſhip</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and come to the Spirit and Truth in their own Hearts; and in that to Worſhip the God of Truth, who is a Spirit, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſo by the Spirit of Truth, they come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which cometh down out of Heaven from God. So this is a true, certain, ſtanding, infallible and perfect Worſhip; for Truth and the Spirit of God is certain, infallible and perfect; and ſo this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a certain perfect Worſhip. And ſo every one, as I ſaid before, come to the Truth in your own Hearts, and to the Spirit of God, or elſe you cannot Worſhip the God of Truth, who is a <hi>Spirit:</hi> And every Man that Worſhips in the whole World, who would find this Spirit and Truth, they muſt go into the Temple.</p>
               <p>And ſo in the Spirit and Truth Worſhip God, who is a <hi>Spirit;</hi> and this <hi>Spirit</hi> gives an Underſtanding to know God, who is a Spirit; and the Truth, and to know the God of Truth, who is to be worſhipped in the Spirit and Truth, who is <hi>God</hi> bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

So <hi>Chriſt</hi> is manifeſt in the Fleſh, to condemn the Sin that is in the Fleſh; that every one that witneſſes <hi>Chriſt</hi> condemning Sin in the Fleſh, that they through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that condemns Sin in the Fleſh, might

For many have had the <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but loſt the <hi>Life;</hi> the <hi>Notion,</hi> but loſt the <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> the <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> but loſt the <hi>Subſtance, Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> but the <hi>true Fellowſhip</hi> is in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was; and ſince Men loſt this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> they have not known the <hi>Scriptures</hi> aright, but they have ſet up <hi>Fellowſhips</hi> by that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is of him that is out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> that have deſtroyed one another, and perſecuted them which are in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil,</hi> and all the <hi>Fellowſhips</hi> in old <hi>Adam</hi> was, and will be when they are all gone.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Goſpel-Fellowſhip</hi> is a perfect <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> a pure and an holy <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> it is an everlaſting <hi>Fellowſhip;</hi> for the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, it is over the <hi>Jews</hi> Fellowſhip in the outward things, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> invented Fellowſhips, and the Fellowſhips of Bread, Water and Wine; for theſe are no Myſteries, the World's Fellowſhip is no Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Fellowſhip of Bread, Water and Wine is no Myſtery; but the Goſpel-Fellowſhip is a Myſtery, and none ſees it, but who comes to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the <hi>Truth</hi> in the inward parts: For this is a ſtanding Fellowſhip, the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and all Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips out of it are imperfect and corrupt, where the Body of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> and their <hi>Purgatory</hi> is pleaded for, which Fellowſhips below, Men make, and are of Men, and from Men; but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not of Men, nor by Men, but of God, and from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the <hi>Church-Fellowſhip</hi> that is in God, and it is a pure <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel-Fellowſhip</hi> is, which <hi>Goſpel</hi> brings <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> and expels away all that which darkens, and burdens, and loads the Soul, Mind, Spirit and Heart. So this is Glad-Tidings to the <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> which comes by the <hi>Immortal Power</hi> up to the <hi>Immortal God,</hi> where <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> comes to <hi>Light,</hi> and to ſhine over him that hath darkened it: Here is liberty to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul, Mind,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is the <hi>Goſpel-Fellowſhip,</hi> which is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> (but Bondage and Darkneſs to the other) ſo <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> is hid from all them that makes Fellowſhips below, and have their Fellowſhips by Men, and of Men, who are out of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and makes Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of old <hi>Authors,</hi> and makes Fellowſhips of the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> But being erred from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they know not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and there they are in <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Enmity</hi> in their <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> and falling-out about their <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> ſome taking it one way, ſome another; and falling-out about their handy Works, and plucking People from one another to themſelves, and not to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:96751:140"/>nor his <hi>Goſpel-Fellowſhip,</hi> that came not by Men, neither was it of Man. So they that deny <hi>Revelation</hi> cannot preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> until he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, nor cannot preach the <hi>Goſpel</hi> until it be revealed. And they that ſay <hi>Revelations</hi> are ceaſed, they may as well ſay, there is no <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and ſo have no <hi>Chriſt</hi> to preach, and are only <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Letter;</hi> neither have they the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to preach, which are revealed to them that fear him. And that is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> from the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> that is out of the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> where is Enmity, which ſpeaks it ſelf ſufficiently abroad among all their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhips; and into this <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, he cannot get.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> hath been loſt ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore People have been found in their own <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> and therefore they are all found out of <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and one with another; for where there is <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> there is <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Sanctification</hi> hath been loſt ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days; therefore both <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> are found in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> and preach up the Body of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> and a <hi>Purgatory;</hi> and ſo have forſaken him that ſhould ſanctifie them, and make them clean.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Sanctifying Belief</hi> hath been loſt ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days; for he that <hi>Believes</hi> is born of God; and he that <hi>Believes</hi> in the <hi>Light,</hi> may become a <hi>Child</hi> of the <hi>Light;</hi> every one that cometh into the World are enlightned by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they ſhould believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> as he commands them, and ſo become <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light;</hi> and he that <hi>believes,</hi> overcomes the <hi>World.</hi> And if there be no overcoming on this ſide of the Grave, as the World's Preachers, made of Men, ſay, then there is no true Believing on this ſide of the Grave; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World is not overcome in them; and he that is their God, is of the World alſo: For <hi>he that believes, overcomes the World; for greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World:</hi> So this greater overcomes the leſs, and he that Believes paſſes from Death; and Sin, that brings Death, and the <hi>Devil</hi> the Power of Death. So becomes a <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and of the <hi>Day;</hi> and of the <hi>Light,</hi> which was before <hi>Darkneſs</hi> was, or the <hi>Prince</hi> of it; for this is the Belief that overcomes the World, that ſanctifies the Unbelieving Husband, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Wife, elſe their Childeen were unholy, but now they are clean, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p>For this Belief is greater than he that is of the World, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him that would defile; for this Belief in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which paſſes from <hi>Death</hi> to <hi>Life,</hi> it takes away the root of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> which is complained of in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which they were born in, though they had the <hi>Law</hi> which made nothing perfect, which took hold of their outward Actions or <hi>Branches;</hi> but this Belief makes the Root holy, and if the Root be holy, the Branches that ſprings from the Root will be holy alſo.</p>
               <p>And all you that preach up a Body of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and that you muſt have a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> unto the Grave, and a <hi>Purgatory</hi> when you are Dead. Neither Man nor Woman of you do believe aright; for the Believing Wife ſanctifies the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband; and the Believing Husband ſanctifies the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96751:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>Wife; elſe their Children were unclean, but now they are holy.</p>
               <p>So from this <hi>Sanctifying Belief</hi> you are all erred ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days: But have made <hi>Beliefs</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> of your own, and then ſay, there is no overcoming on this ſide of the Grave; you may as well ſay, there is no true Belief.</p>

               <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> my Deſire is, That ye all may be preſerved in the Lord's <hi>Power,</hi> and in his <hi>Everlaſting Seed,</hi> and ſo in the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and in the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> of the Increaſe of which there is no end.

               <p>And that ye may keep your ancient Teſtimony for the <hi>Church</hi> which is in <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Living Members,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> is the <hi>Holy Head</hi> of, and your <hi>Heavenly Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation.</hi>

And the ground of our Order of the <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was; and all that be Heirs of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> to <hi>Light</hi> in them, which ſhines over him that hath darkned them, and was before he was: I ſay, they are Heirs of the <hi>Comely Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and therefore, I ſay, take your <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of it, and walk as becomes the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and keep the <hi>Comely Order</hi> of it, and in it keep your <hi>Meetings:</hi> And here is the Ground and Foundation of our <hi>Womens Meetings.</hi> Now <hi>Mothers</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> that has the ordering of <hi>Children, Maids,</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> may do a great deal of Good in their Families, to the making or ſpoiling of their <hi>Children, Maids</hi> and <hi>Servants;</hi> and many things Women may do, and ſpeak of, amongſt Women, which is not Mens buſineſs. So, as I ſaid before, that you, both Men and Women, be helps meet in the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> as Man and Woman was in the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> before they frll; and not only ſo, but in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and in his <hi>Goſpel</hi> that never fell, nor never will fall, whoſe <hi>Foundation</hi> ſtands ſure, for all his <hi>Members</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> to build upon. And ſo ſee that nothing be lacking amongſt you, then all will be well.</p>
               <p>And the Elder Women in the <hi>Truth</hi> were not only called <hi>Elders,</hi> but <hi>Mothers.</hi>

So all that are come to that Office, Growth and Stature, be diligent; for a <hi>Mother</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is beyond all the <hi>Mothers</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Harlots, Myſtery Babylon,</hi> who had Power over <hi>Tongues, Nations</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> with the <hi>Cup</hi> of her <hi>Fornication:</hi> But the <hi>Mothers</hi> in <hi>Spiritual Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> has the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Breaſts</hi> of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> which are full of the <hi>Milk</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> to Suckle all the <hi>Young Ones,</hi> and to Nouriſh, and Inſtruct, Admoniſh, and Exhort, and Rebuke all the contrary; and to Refreſh and Cheriſh every tender One. So the Elder Women and Mothers are to be teachers of good things, and to be teachers of the Younger and trainers up of them in Vertue, in Holineſs, and Godlineſs, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in Wiſdom, and in the Fear of the Lord, in the Chruch of Chriſt. And if the Unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Believing Wife, then who is the Speaker, and who is the Hearer? Surely ſuch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is permitted to ſpeak, and to work the Works of God, and to make a Member in the Church; and then as an Elder, to overſee that they walk according to the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:96751:171"/>thee; but when thou doeſt make a Feaſt, call the Poor, the Maimed, the Lame and the Blind, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed; for they cannot recompence thee again, but thou ſhalt be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi> So here you may ſee how <hi>Chriſt</hi> ordereth thee to make a Feaſt or a Dinner, and to whom, contrary to the World; and tho' it be a croſs to them, yet it is to be obeyed, and obſerved, and practiſed; for it is the <hi>heavenly Man</hi>'s Doctrine, and Command, and Will, and he that doth it ſhall know his Doctrine; and this will judge the World in their vain Feaſts, Dinners and Suppers, which they make for the <hi>Rich,</hi> for which they have ſelfe Reward; but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s command being obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, denieth ſelf, and hath the Lord's Recompence; and all that call him <hi>Lord,</hi> ſhould do as the Lord commandeth; and they that are his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and do love him, will keep his Commands; for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If you love them that love you, what thank have you? For Sinners alſo loves thoſe that love them: And if you do good to them that do good to you, what thank have you? For Sinners alſo do even the ſame: So give and it ſhall be given unto you. Good Meaſure preſſed down, ſhaken together, and running over into your Boſoms;</hi> and the Lord is kind to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, and therefore, <hi>be ye Merciful as your heavenly Father is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,</hi> Luke 6. And therefore as you have forſaken all the World's vain Feaſtings, and Dinners and Suppers (if ſo) give the <hi>Blind,</hi> the <hi>Lame,</hi> the <hi>Maimed,</hi> the <hi>Widow,</hi> the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> and the <hi>Poor,</hi> a Feaſt or a Dinner, and obey Chriſt, the heavenly <hi>Man</hi>'s Doctrine, tho' it do croſs old earthly <hi>Adam</hi>'s Will and Practices; and though he be angry, never heed him, but obey the <hi>Lord.</hi>

Therefore every Man and Womans <hi>Eye</hi> muſt be lifted up to Heaven, and Minds, and Thirſts, and Deſires, and Hearts, and the Soul that hungers, and the Needy that ſighs, and the Poor that groans, for this Bread that comes down from Heaven; and the Spiritual Drink, and ſo they may have the Spiritual Bread in their own Houſes, and heavenly Water in their own Ciſterns, with which they may have to refreſh them felves and others: So, here may all eat and drink to the Praiſe and the Glory of God, for all drinks into one <hi>Spirit:</hi> And as they eat of the Bread that comes down from Heaven, then they can ſay the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> is fulfilled, all <hi>Eyes</hi> are Lifted up unto thee, thou opens with thy <hi>Hand; to wit,</hi> thy <hi>Power;</hi> and thou filleſt with thy Bleſſings; and then with their <hi>Souls, Hearts</hi> and <hi>Spirits, Minds</hi> and <hi>Lips,</hi> they will ſhew forth his Praiſe, in praiſing God, the Creator, who is in all, over all, through all, and above all.</p>
               <p>And therefore, in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Name</hi> you were gathered, keep your <hi>Meetings,</hi> your <hi>Mesn</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> that in the <hi>Power</hi> you may be kept in the <hi>Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in Diligence, in the Church of God, and in his Buſineſs, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, Admoniſhing, Exhoring, Rebuking, ſuch as talk, and does not walk accordingly; ſuch as profeſſes, and does not poſſeſs; and ſuch as are the Sayers, and are not the Doers: So that every ones Life and Converſation may be, as becomes the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Man,</hi> and keep in the <hi>

               <p>So <hi>Friends</hi> are not to meet like a Company of People about Town or Pariſh-Buſineſs, neither in their <hi>Mens</hi> nor <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi>

               <p>And you may ſee how the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> after he had convinced People, he brought them into <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and the Jews after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were brought into the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of God.

               </p>

For it is againſt the <hi>Power</hi> of God, in which the <hi>Order</hi> is eſtabliſh'd, and the <hi>Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> in which the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> were ſet up; in which all things ſhould be eſtabliſh'd, and are faſtned, in the <hi>Light</hi> which <hi>was</hi> before <hi>Darkneſs</hi> was, and in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, and in the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> before the unclean Spirit was, and will ſtand when he is gone. Therefore in it keep your Poſſeſſions in the Power of <hi>God,</hi> and in his Light and Spirit, that you may know the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the Lord, eſtabliſhed above all <hi>Mountains.</hi> And they are none but looſe Spirits, and ſuch as tends to Looſneſs, that ſtand againſt the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> though it may come under pretence to ſet up a better <hi>Way;</hi> or, under pretence only to alter them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Day;</hi> and, it may be, pretend their Fear of the Corruption of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a <hi>Day.</hi> All this is but from a corrupt Spirit of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> which God will blaſt; for we put no Holinſs in the uſual and conſtant <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings.</hi> For I would have them all to know, that they who be Heirs of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> are redeemed out of the vain obſervation of Days, and out of the Jewiſh and Apoſtate Chriſtians Holy-Days, to God by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who made all Days, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96751:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>every thing Good, and their Eyes are to the Super-natural Day of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and they are the Children of this Day.</p>
               <p>And that is a creeping Spirit,<note place="margin">To keep the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Days for Meetings.</note> that would go to alter the uſual and conſtant <hi>Meeting-Days,</hi> under pretence to prevent People from the Corruptions of obſerving a conſtant <hi>Day,</hi> or under a pretence of keeping People out of a <hi>Form,</hi> and ſo would father their Deceit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>God.</hi> For them who be in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Power,</hi> by which all true <hi>Forms,</hi> and all things are upheld (which <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> gives <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to all Things) and all they that are in it, are above all ſuch Things, and Judges all ſuch dark <hi>Spirits.</hi> And they that be in the Obſervation of <hi>Days,</hi> they are not Heirs of the <hi>Power,</hi> nor of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was before <hi>Days</hi> was; and ſuch cannot ſit in the heavenly Places in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to do his Churches Buſineſs. So, I ſay, that after People were turned to the <hi>Light, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and they all come into the <hi>Light, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> all ſuch are to make up the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings;</hi> and in it to feel the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which all things were made and created, and with it to be ordered, and to order all things to God's Glory. So that <hi>Wiſdom may be juſtified of her Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning laying all Marriages before the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings.</hi> Some have darkly objected, This is not as was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Whereas in the Beginning we were but few in <hi>Number,</hi> and could not preſently be ſo ſenſible of the ſervice of them, as when grown more numerous, and a Body of People; but in the Beginning there was a Care things might be kept clear: For, in 1653, ſeveral <hi>Friends</hi> came to me, concerning Marriage, and to know what they ſhould do in that Caſe. And I waited upon the Lord, and ſaw in his <hi>Eternal Light,</hi> that all that did Marry, they ſhould lay it before ſome faithful <hi>Friends</hi> in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, that they might ſee into it: Theſe were my Words then, as in a Paper of mine, given forth that Year, may be ſeen.</p>
               <p>And afterwards I was moved to go round the <hi>Nation,</hi> to adviſe to the ſetting up the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> and to write to thoſe Places where I could not go; That all the Faithful might keep their <hi>Meetings</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and in it be ſettled, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And that all Marriages might be laid before the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings,</hi> who were in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Goſpel Order,</hi> who had the Care of the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that they in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God might look into it, and ſee that they were clear from all other Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore now that Pretence is generally taken away from all, they cannot ſay now, That they cannot tell where to find a <hi>Meeting</hi> of the Faithful, to lay their Marriages before them, before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it in the common <hi>Publick Meetings.</hi> Now that the <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> are ſettled in the <hi>Power</hi> of God, to look after the Churches Affairs; for all knows where they may be found at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Days, Times</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> to lay it before them. And they that go together in the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> will be willing to lay their Marriages before them that be in the ſame <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God: So that all things may be done in <hi>Truth, Love,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Pureneſs, Clearneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to the Praiſe and Glory of God.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96751:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>And all, whoſoever they be, that oppoſe this good <hi>Order,</hi> are looſe Spirits, out of the <hi>Power</hi> of God; and their Work tends to <hi>Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and to draw into a looſe <hi>Liberty,</hi> under a deceitful Pretence of keeping People out of <hi>Forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the ſame Power and Spirit, that directed all <hi>Marriages</hi> to be laid before the Faithful, at the firſt, when there were but few <hi>Friends,</hi> in many parts of the <hi>Nations,</hi> and no Mens nor Womens <hi>Meetings:</hi> I ſay, the ſame Power of God that did convince Friends at the firſt, the ſame Power and Spirit directed to the ſetting up the Mens and Womens <hi>Meetings,</hi> that they might be in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Goſpel, and its Order. And the ſame Power and Spirit of God ſet up our Order for <hi>Marriages</hi> in our Mens and Womens <hi>Meetings:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">All to ſeeck firſt to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents before they engage the Affection of the Child.</note> And that all are to ſpeak firſt to their Parents, and have their Conſent, before they engage the Affections of the Children; and this Order is ſettled by the Power of God, in the Men and Womens <hi>Meetings;</hi> for ſome formerly did ſpeak to neither Father nor Mother, till they had drawn out, and entangled the Affections of the Daughter; and that brought great troubles and diſcontent upon the Parents, and among Friends. And therefore this is to be enquired into, in the Men and Womens <hi>Meetings,</hi> where their Marriages are to be ſpoken of: So as Friends come to Truth, which the Devil is out of, and to the Power of God, which was before the Devil was; all being Heirs of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and Heirs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, take your <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and come into the Order of <hi>Life,</hi> and into the Order of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and then you will have a Witneſs in your ſelves, and will ſay with me, our Order is not of Man, nor by Man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and his Goſpel; and of his <hi>Government,</hi> the increaſe of which there is no end. And ſo all be faithful, keeping in your <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> and in your <hi>Inheritance,</hi> in that where no <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> can come: For I muſt tell you, here is the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſtirring, if it could prevail, that would lay waſte God's <hi>Heritage,</hi> and bring you out of your <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> that it might rule over you: But if you keep your <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Order,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> you will rule over it, being <hi>in</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> the Foundation of God, that ſtands ſure; thought ſome earthly looſe Spirits it may draw after them. But mark the end of it; for the <hi>Power</hi> remains, and will remain, and the <hi>Seed</hi> reigns over the Head of all ſuch falſe Spirits,<note place="margin">A Warning to Oppoſe rs.</note> and Orders, and Governments, that is not ſet up by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and it will grind them to pieces: That is the Word of the Lord God to you, let whoever will oppoſe it; for the <hi>Power</hi> was before they were, and will ſtand when they are gone: For all our <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> which are ſet up by the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, theſe <hi>Meetings</hi> are for the Practiſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to ſee that all that do profeſs <hi>Truth,</hi> do practiſe it and walk in it. And all ſuch as are againſt them, are begetters of People into talking, and not walking, and of Saying, but not Doing; and ſuch always were Judged by all them that walk in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the pure <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that is undefiled before God, that kept and keeps from the Spots of the World: And all ſuch are never like to proſper, that are againſt the Practice of the pure <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, as I ſaid before, live in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and its <hi>Order,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96751:184"/>or the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> either; and know his Government; of the increaſe of which there is no End, who is ſet up from Everlaſting to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And live in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> one with another; for that edifies the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that is it, which will bear all things; and in the <hi>Patience</hi> run the Race, and have the Crown, and keep in the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that will have the Victory.</p>
               <p>And ſuch Oppoſers as crys againſt <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> of Men, they are the moſt in it themſelves this Day, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into a Separation, by <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions;</hi> and under a Pretence of crying againſt ſuch things, oppoſe the <hi>Power,</hi> and them that be in the Poſſeſſion of it. But the <hi>Power</hi> will blaſt them, and make them to wither, like the Graſs and Corn on the Houſe-top, as it did <hi>John Parrot</hi> and his Company; to whom it was the Word of the Lord then, and ſo it is to theſe now; and the <hi>Word</hi> lives, and abides, and endures for ever.</p>
               <p>So with my <hi>Love</hi> in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to you all, in whom is my Labour and Travel for your Eternal Good and Settlement, upon the Eternal Rock. <hi>Amen.</hi> Farewell.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 319.</note> and the <hi>Caribee</hi> Iſlands there abouts, I have ſeen a Letter from ſome of you, wherein I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that there has been ſome Scruple concerning <hi>Watching,</hi> or ſending forth <hi>Watch-Men</hi> in your own way.</p>
               <p>Truly <hi>Friends,</hi> this I declare to you,<note place="margin">Advice to Friends, to keep Watch in their own Way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> That it is a great <hi>Mercy</hi> of the Lord, to ſubject the <hi>Govenor</hi>'s Mind ſo much by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that he will permit you to <hi>Watch</hi> in your own way, without carrying <hi>Arms,</hi> which is a very civil thing, and to be taken notice of: For, Could <hi>Friends</hi> obtain the ſame in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and other places, they would willingly have done it, and did profer themſelves for to do it to the <hi>Governors.</hi> But becauſe that they would not bring <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Guns,</hi> and other <hi>Arms,</hi> to watch againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they pretended; their ſtanding Fine was about 17 <hi>s.</hi> each Man's neglect, but they took often 30 <hi>s.</hi> worth for it, and tied ſome of them <hi>neck</hi> and <hi>heels</hi> beſides, till the Blood hath come forth at their Mouths, Noſe, and Ears: And this I have ſeen upon Record, who freely profer'd to watch in their own way, but it would not be accepted. And in other places it hath been the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now as for Watching in it ſelf: Don't you Watch your <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> againſt <hi>Thieves</hi> in the <hi>Night?</hi> And are not common Watches, ſet to diſcover <hi>Thieves</hi> in the Towns, or <hi>Houſe-Breakers,</hi> or ſuch as might wickedly <hi>Fire Houſes?</hi> Such civil Things we were ſubject to, and do ſubmit our ſelves, for Conſcience ſake, unto every ſuch <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> which are for the puniſhment of Evil Doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Evil Doers that may Rob your <hi>Plantations,</hi> or <hi>Houſes,</hi> you complaine to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> for the Puniſhment of them, tho' you cannot Swear againſt them; or if the <hi>Indians</hi> come to Rob your <hi>Plantations,</hi> or <hi>Houſes,</hi> you complaine to the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch <hi>evil doers,</hi> to ſtop them, which <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are for the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of them that do well. So this <hi>Watching</hi> is for the preventing <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> and ſtopping <hi>Burning</hi> of <hi>Houſes:</hi> So we do ſubmit to every ſuch <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> for the Lord's ſake; for the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96751:186"/>to Submiſſion; whether it be to the <hi>King,</hi> as ſupreme; or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;</hi> as unto them that are ſent by him; for the Puniſhing of the Evil Doers,<note place="margin">Of Subjection to Magiſtraies.</note> and for the praiſe of them that do well; for ſo it is the Will of God, that with well doing you might put to Silence the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Fooliſh Men, as free, not uſing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as Servants of God; ſo that Juſtice, and Truth and Righteouſneſs may be ſet upon the Unrighteous and Unjnſt, not uſing this Liberty for a Cloak of Unrighteouſneſs to any one, but as Servants in the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Righteous God,</hi> as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and in <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Put them in mind to obey Magiſtrates, and to be ready to every good Work:</hi> Mark (every <hi>good Work</hi>) that is againſt the <hi>evil,</hi> as Drunkeneſs, Murder, Whordom, theſe and all manner of Uncleanneſs; ſo far we can obey them, in the <hi>Lord's Power</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> as they act againſt the Evil, and that which diſhonours God; and if they Act againſt the <hi>Good,</hi> or if they would comple us to thoſe things, which is matter of Conſcience in us towards God, we reſiſt not, bur ſuffer under them: For <hi>Rulers</hi> are not to be a Terror to the <hi>Good Workers,</hi> but to the <hi>Evil,</hi> and wilt thou then not be afraid of the <hi>Power;</hi> do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame; for he is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to thee for good, for he ſhould keep down the <hi>Evil,</hi> but if thou doſt that which is <hi>Evil,</hi> be afraid; for he beareth not the <hi>Sword</hi> in vain; for he is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to Revenge and Execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil.<note place="margin">Who is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor of Wrath upon the Evil Doer.</note> So he is the Revenger and Executioner of the <hi>Wrath</hi> upon the Evil Doer, as God hath placed him, upon the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> and him that <hi>Steals</hi> or <hi>Kills,</hi> and <hi>bears falſe Witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. But when the Magiſtrate turns his <hi>Sword</hi> backward upon the Juſt and Righteous, then he abuſes his Power, and therein the <hi>Juſt</hi> ſuffers under him: And therefore ſuch has been Warned by the <hi>Juſt,</hi> as you may ſee through the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> So you are not to be the Revengers, but he is the <hi>Revenger;</hi> and to that Power that executes the Revenge, and brings the Sword upon the <hi>Adulterer, Murderer, Thief, falſe Witneſs,</hi> and other <hi>Evil Doers,</hi> we muſt be ſubject to that Power, and own that Power, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake; which is for the Puniſhment of the Evil Doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well. For if any ſhould come to <hi>Burn</hi> your <hi>Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Rob</hi> you, or come to <hi>Raviſh</hi> your <hi>Wives</hi> or <hi>Daughters,</hi> or a Company ſhould come to <hi>Fire</hi> a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Town,</hi> or come to <hi>Kill People;</hi> don't you watch againſt all ſuch Actions? And won't you watch againſt ſuch evil things in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in your own way? You cannot but diſcover ſuch things to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are to Puniſh ſuch things; and therefore the Watch is kept and ſet to diſcover ſuch to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> that they may be Puniſhed; and if he does it not, he bears his <hi>Sword</hi> in vain. So if thou watches thy own <hi>Plantation</hi> againſt <hi>Thieves,</hi> in thy own way, which thou art deſired, for the good of thy ſelf and Neghbours, againſt ſuch as would <hi>Burn</hi> thy <hi>Plantation,</hi> and thy Neighbours, and <hi>Deſtroy</hi> and <hi>Rob</hi> you, wilt not thou diſcover this to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> to Puniſh ſuch Evil Doers, who is ſet for the Puniſhing of the Evil Doers, and Executing Wrath upon them, and for the Praiſe of them that do well? Surely Yes.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:96751:186"/>
               <p>And for this cauſe we pay tribute to them, and give <hi>Ceſar</hi> his due, that we may live a Godly and Peaceable Life under them, as they are God's Miniſters attending upon this very thing, to wit, the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Evil Doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well; for the <hi>Law</hi> was not made for the <hi>Righteous,</hi> but for the <hi>Sinner</hi> and <hi>Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> which is good in its place. Now if they do not do their Duty, we are clear in giving them their <hi>Tribute</hi> or <hi>Cuſtoms;</hi> I ſay, if they do not do their Duty to keep down Evil Doers, and be for the Praiſe of them that do well, God Almighty will turn againſt them. But if the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> would have all, both <hi>God</hi>'s due, and <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s too, that we cannot give; for God muſt have his Worſhip, his Praiſe, his Honour, and his Due; and <hi>Ceſar</hi> muſt have his Due,<note place="margin">Render to God the things which are his, and to Ceſar the things which are his.</note> his earthly Cuſtom and Tribute; and ſo herein, we <hi>render unto God the things which are God's, and unto</hi> Ceſar <hi>the things which are his.</hi> And whereas ſome may ſay, That the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would not eat Fleſh, leſt he ſhould offend his Brother, that was upon a Religious Account; and not to give offence to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> who is ſet for the Puniſhing of the Evil Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</p>
               <p>And whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Wherefore if you be dead with Chriſt, from the Rudiments of the World; why, as though living in the World, are ye ſubject to Ordinances, touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all are to periſh with the uſing, after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men?</hi> Now theſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> theſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> theſe <hi>Commandments,</hi> were concerning <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip;</hi> and that was another thing, where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake; for the Puniſhment of Evil Doers,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. For this was for the Lord's ſake, which was <hi>for the Praiſe of them that do well, and for the Puniſhment of the Evil Doer.</hi> So he makes a diſtinction here.</p>
               <p>And you know that Maſters of <hi>Ships,</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> have their Watches all Night long, and they Watch to preſerve the <hi>Ship,</hi> and to prevent any <hi>Enemy,</hi> or <hi>Hurts,</hi> that might come to the <hi>Ship,</hi> by Paſſengers, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> came in the <hi>Fourth Watch</hi> of the <hi>Night, walking on the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>was in the Ship, and his Diſciples,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. and in <hi>Mark</hi> 6. and 48.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Simon Peter</hi> had part of the <hi>Ship,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 5. And ſo it was that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> were Partners with Simon.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.38, 39. ſpeaking of his Coming,<note place="margin">We are to keep our Watch, both outwardly and inwardly</note> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to watch, <hi>If he</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Maſter</hi>) <hi>ſhould come in the ſecond or third Watch, and find them Watching, bleſſed are thoſe Servants.</hi> So this Watching was for Chriſt, and againſt Sin and Evil in their own Hearts. And then he brings a Compariſon, <hi>And this know, that if the good Man of the Houſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>had known what Hour the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not ſuffered his Houſe to be broken up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ſo here is the good Man's watching againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> without, and the <hi>Spoiler</hi> and <hi>Thief</hi> without, whom the Magiſtrate is to Revenge, and to lay his Sword upon: And here is alſo a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> within, and a waiting to receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord at his Coming.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:96751:187"/>
               <p>And as there is a ſhutting the outward Doors, to keep out the <hi>Murderers</hi> and the <hi>Thieves,</hi> and a <hi>Bolting</hi> and <hi>Locking</hi> of them out: So there is a ſhutting up, and locking the Door of the Heart, to keep out the <hi>Adulterer</hi> and <hi>Murderer,</hi> and all that is <hi>Deceitful,</hi> from coming within, into the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> uſed to bring this Scripture, <hi>You muſt be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake;</hi> to the end that we ſhould pay them their Maintenance, and hold up their Worſhip.</p>
               <p>And when the Magiſtrates brought that Scripture for theſe ends, we could not obey them in theſe things, nor <hi>touch,</hi> nor <hi>taſte</hi> their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Doctrines nor Commandments. But <hi>to be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake;</hi> which was <hi>for the Puniſhment of Evil Doers;</hi> as Drunkards, Thieves, Murderers, Adulterers, and ſuch like, and to keep down ſuch Evil Doers, and that we might live a Godly and Peaceable Life under them; which was <hi>for the Praiſe of them that do well;</hi> this we always owned, and were ſubject to, and watched againſt, and declared againſt in our own way, and laid ſuch Actors and Actions before the Magiſtrates, for them to puniſh, and keep down with their Power,<note place="margin">If a Magiſtrate compel againſt our Conſcience, we patiently Suffer.</note> which is their Sword of Juſtice; but if they would compel us to things that we could not do, contrary to our Conſcience, for the Lords ſake, we ſuffered for it.</p>
               <p>So where <hi>Friends</hi> has the Government, as in <hi>Rhode</hi> Iſland, and that Province <hi>Friends</hi> was willing to watch, in their own way, and they made a Law, that none ſhould be compelled to take <hi>Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Friends</hi> have always profered the Magiſtrates, though they could not joyn with then in carrying <hi>Arms, Swords</hi> and <hi>Piſtols;</hi> yet to watch in their own way againſt the Evil Doer.</p>
               <p>And this they have profered in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> as I have heard, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, if <hi>Negroes</hi> ſhould riſe up to Burn <hi>Plantations,</hi> or Steal, or do any hurt, or other <hi>Indians</hi> invading their Land.</p>
               <p>And ſo if the foreign <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould come to Steal your Goods, or to Kill; for you to be left to your freedom to watch in your own way, and to diſcover to the Magiſtrate ſuch as would deſtroy your <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Plantations,</hi> or <hi>Steal,</hi> let them come from at home, or come from abroad, ſuch Evil Doers the Magiſtrate is to puniſh, who is <hi>for the Praiſe of them that do well.</hi> So that you may live and lead a Godly and Peaceable Life under them: And you that are Righteous, you watching, diſcovering and declaring againſt ſuch Evil doers, and things, you clear your ſelves, and demonſtrate that your teſtimony is againſt ſuch things: And if the Magiſtrates ſhould be evily inclined, and God ſhould bring the Evil Doers as a Rod upon them; yet you are clear in your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that knows <hi>Truth,</hi> and are in your <hi>Duty,</hi> and in your <hi>Obedience.</hi> And for this cauſe he has his <hi>Tributs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To give to the Magiſtrate Tribute, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Due, and double Honour.</note> and his <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> and his <hi>Due,</hi> and <hi>double Honour,</hi> if he Rules well, and God has his Praiſe, and his Honour; and in that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is againſt <hi>

               <p>And if he be a <hi>Praiſe</hi> to the Evil, and a <hi>Diſcouragement</hi> to the Good, then the Lord will deal with him; and tho' to ſuch, for Conſcience, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96751:187"/>for the Lord's ſake, we cannot be ſubject to the <hi>Evil,</hi> but rather ſuffer thereby, and are ſubject to that which puniſhes and keeps down the <hi>Evil,</hi> and are glad of it: And we deſire that Juſtice were uppermoſt in all Magiſtrates, that they would hear <hi>Friends</hi> at their <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> that do come to them, and diſcover to them the Evil, and that they might ſee what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould not do. So <hi>Friends</hi> may diſcover all that which is Evil, which comes to devour and deſtroy, both within and without; both within the Iſland and without, to them that ſhould keep it down.</p>
               <p>And ſo, in the Lord's Everlaſting <hi>Power,</hi> in which Freedom is and Dominion, the Lord God Almighty keep you in his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which brings <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>Light</hi> in you, that you may ſee over the <hi>Devil</hi> that had darkned you, and kept you in a ſeparation from God: So that by his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of God, which was before the <hi>Devil</hi> was, and will be when he is gone, who was the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Strife:</hi> That in that <hi>Power</hi> you may all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approach to God, and in it feel nothing betwixt you and the Lord of hindring your Paſſage unto him. So that in this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of God, in which <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> is brought to <hi>Light,</hi> you may keep and feel your Everlaſting <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> which is not of Man, nor by Man.</p>
               <p>So with my <hi>Love</hi> to all <hi>Friends</hi> in all thoſe Parts, as though I named them; and be at <hi>Peace</hi> one with another; neither Judge one another about ſuch things, but live in <hi>Love,</hi> which doth edifie.

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 320.</note> You may read in the old <hi>World,</hi> how one FAmily after another, till <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, ſerved the Lord God. And then from <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their Wives, and after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that they were come to be a great People, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I would all the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were Prophets,</hi> Numb. 11.29. And when a young Man ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Eldad and Medad do Propheſie in the Camp;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired that all the Lord's People were Prophets.</note> and he would have had <hi>Moſes</hi> to forbid them: But <hi>Moſes</hi> anſered and ſaid unto him again, <hi>Would to God all the Lord's People were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> here (who was Captain, Governour, and Judge over <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>) was far from reſtraining any from Propheſying in the Camp, but reproved his Envy that would have had him forbid them; and did moreover encourage them, by ſaying, <hi>I would to God all the Lord's People were Prophets:</hi> And ſurely all the Lord's People are made up of both <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Lord having given his <hi>Law</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was Holy, Juſt, and Good, the Lord ſaid, <hi>I have poured out my Spirit upon the Houſe of Iſrael:</hi> So that by this <hi>Spirit,</hi> they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his <hi>Law,</hi> which was Spiritual, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.29.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:96751:189"/>
               <p>Now in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> there were the Aſſemblies of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1676"/> for all the Women that were wiſe of Hearth, did work with their Hands about thoſe holy Things which God had commanded.</p>
               <p>And all the Women thoſe Hearts ſtirred them up in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</note> theſe Women wrought about thoſe holy Things that belonged to the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Women, in the 38th <hi>Chap.</hi> and of the Womens aſſEmbling at the Door of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the Congregation; and in the Margent it's ſaid, <hi>They aſſembled by Troops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, here you may ſee, That the Women were in the Work and Service of God, as well as the Men; and they had their <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi> For God had poured out of his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to give them an Underſtanding, both Men and Women, to do that, and make thoſe things which God had commanded, which were called <hi>holy things;</hi> which were but <hi>Figares</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the <hi>Subſtance, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Holy One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Seventy Elders,</hi> did not ſay to thoſe <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Women, We can do our Work our ſelves, and you are more fitter to be at home to waſh the Diſhes; or ſuch-like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; but they did encourage them in Work and Sevice of God, in thoſe things which God had commanded them in the time of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For God having pured his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God give his Spirit to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Law.</note> to give them an Underſtading, to do thoſe things, which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; by which <hi>Spirit</hi> their Hearts were ſtirred up to do God's Work, both <hi>Males</hi> and <hi>Females.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> the Women were to offer up <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> as well as the Men, upon God's <hi>Altar;</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe brought <hi>Samuel,</hi> and offered him up to the Lord, ſhe brought him to the Houſe of the Lord in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and when ſhe brought him, ſhe took up with her three Bullocks, beſides Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wine: So ſee how ſhe paid her <hi>Vows</hi> to the Lord, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up her <hi>Sacrifices</hi> upon God's <hi>Altar.</hi> And other Places might be ſhewed of the Womens <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you may ſee <hi>Hannah</hi>'s fervent Zeal to God, and what a large Speech ſhe made in magnifying and exalting the Lord, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1ſt. and 2d. <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo you may ſee, the <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Women were accepted upon God's <hi>Altar,</hi> as well as the Mens.</p>
               <p>But the hire of a Whore was not to be brought into the Houſe of God for any Vow, for it was an abomination to the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.10.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Hannah</hi>'s Husband, and the other Womens Husbands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hannah</hi>'s Offering.</note> that offered up their <hi>Offerings</hi> upon God's <hi>Altar,</hi> were not offended at them, nor did they ſay, their <hi>Offerings</hi> were enough for them both; but every one was to offer up their <hi>Peace-Offerings</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving-Offerings</hi> themſelves, and other <hi>Offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here youmay ſee the Service and Work of the Women, and how ſerviceable the Women were in their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> about the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Holy Things,</hi> and how the Women
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96751:190"/>offered upon God's <hi>Altar,</hi> as well as the Men, they had their Liberty. But the hire of the Whore was to be kept out of God's <hi>Houſe,</hi> and not to be offered up upon <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ye may ſee man and Woman were meet helps in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> before the <hi>Fall;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Law</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> which went over <hi>Death</hi> (and <hi>Sin</hi> that brought it) who ſaw the State of Man and Woman in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> Men and Women in the time of the <hi>Law</hi> were meet helps again to one another, in the Work and Service of the holy Things about the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and the Women had their <hi>Aſſemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it's ſaid, in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>That the Lord would pur cut of his Spirit upon all Fleſh in the laſt Days or Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this <hi>Spirit</hi> being poured upon all Fleſh in the Chriſtian Times,<note place="margin">God poureth his Spirit upon all Fleſh under the Goſpel.</note> Sons and Daughters, Hand-maids and Servants, old Men and young Men, that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> all theſe might have his Viſions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and Dreams: and this is his <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which all ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the things that be <hi>Eternal,</hi> and to ſerve <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> both Men and Women, Sons and Daughters, old Men and young Men, Hand-maids and Servants; and all offer up to <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all being dead in old earthly <hi>Adam, Chriſt,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> has taſted <hi>Death</hi> for them all, and is a Propitiation for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole World, and he enlightens all, and his <hi>Grace</hi> hath appeared unto all, and his <hi>Spirit</hi> is poured upon all Fleſh, and his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is preached to every Creature under <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, muſt not all receive the <hi>Grace,</hi> and believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> and receive this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and walk and labour in it, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Sons and Daughters, old Men and young, Servants and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids.</p>
               <p>Yea, I ſay, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> being preached to all Nations, and to every Creature under Heaven, old Men and young, Servants and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, Sons and Daughters; I ſay, then muſt not all theſe receive this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace?</hi> And are they not all to walk in it? and to offer up their <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices</hi> upon the heavenly <hi>Altar,</hi> in the New <hi>Covenant,</hi> and to walk in the New and Living Way; and all to receive the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which enlightens all; and to become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Light,</hi> and to feel the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to cleanſe them from all <hi>Sin,</hi> which they have in old <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as the Women were to offer in the old <hi>Covenant,</hi> and in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> upon the outward Altar their <hi>Offerings;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> poured out his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might underſtand, and do what he commanded them: At which time they had the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi> of the Women, which were not forbidden.</p>
               <p>So now, in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the Day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which enlightens all, and in the time of his <hi>Grace,</hi> which hath appeared unto all Men, to teach them, and to bring their <hi>Salvation;</hi> and in the time of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> preached to every Creature, and in the time of his pouring out of his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon all Fleſh, that they might underſtand, and walk, and live in his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and by his <hi>Spirit</hi> offer up their <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:96751:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>So in this the Time and Day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the captain of our <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> muſt not all theſe Labour in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and in the <hi>Word,</hi> and in the <hi>Grace,</hi> and in the <hi>Light,</hi> and know and do <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Work and Service about his <hi>heavenly Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſſemblies of the Women in the time of the Coſpol. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Hath not every one their Service that are enlightened? And his <hi>Grace,</hi> that hath appeared unto them, are they not Stewards of it? And muſt not they have their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Women in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> as well as in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of the <hi>old Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And are not all to albour in that which tends to God'd Glory, and Praiſe, and Honour? For which End he hath made them all, and for which End he hath redeemed them, and converted them, and tranſlated and ſanctified them, to make them VeſſEls of his <hi>Honour,</hi> and of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo now the End of all our Men and Womens <hi>Meetings</hi> in the time of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being the Authority of them) is, That they might all labour in his <hi>Power,</hi> and in his <hi>Grace,</hi> and in his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in his <hi>Light,</hi> to his <hi>Service,</hi> and his <hi>Buſineſs</hi> in Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>So the Women in the time of the <hi>Goſpel, Light</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> are to look into their own ſelves and Families, and to look to the Training up of their Children; for they are oft-times more amongſt them than the Men, and may prevent many things that may fall out, and many times they may make or marr their Children in their Education.</p>
               <p>So now they come to be exerciſed in the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and exhort, reprove and rebuke, and to keep all their <hi>Families</hi> modeſt, honeſt, vertuous, ſober and civil, and not to gibe Liberty, nor indulge that which tends to Vice, or Laſiviouſneſs, or any Evil, or Idleneſs, or Sloathfulneſs, or the Faſhions of the World, which paſs away; and to ſtop all vain Words, and idle Talking, and Stories and Tales, which are unproffitable; but rather to turn their Ears to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which they ſhould be trained up and exerciſed in, and not to fulfil the Luſt of the Eye; for that being ſatisfied, brings the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and then comes the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> and this is not of the <hi>Father,</hi> but of the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if either Men or Women ſuffer ſuch things, they ſuffer that which defiles their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Families;</hi> And therefore ſuch things are to be reproved in <hi>Families,</hi> and their <hi>Children</hi> to be ſtop'd from going into ſuch things.</p>
               <p>And therefore they are to have an Eſteem of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> above all ſuch things, and not to indulge any ſuch things as will draw out their Minds from Vertue to Vice.</p>
               <p>Now when the Women are met together in the <hi>Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Women when met, to be helpful to one another.</note> and in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> ſome are of a more large Capacity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding than other Women, and are able to inform, and inſtruct, and ſtir up others into Diligence, Vertue, and Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs, and in the Love and Wiſdom of God, to <hi>Inform</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> their <hi>Families,</hi> and to help them that be of weaker Capacities and Underſtandings in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that they may be fruitful in every good Work and Word.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:96751:191"/>
               <p>So that they may ſee that all their <hi>Families</hi> are ordered to God's Glory; and that which tends to Looſneſs or Evil, either in words, ways or actions, that would corrupt them, either in their Lives or Manners, may be kept down and reproved.</p>

               <p>And the Women had their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in the Days of the <hi>Judges</hi> and the <hi>Kings;</hi> and old <hi>Ely</hi>'s Sons abuſed them, and old <hi>Ely</hi> did admoniſh his Sons, but he did not reſTrain them from their Wickedneſs; and therefore God cut off his Sons, and he loſt the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> and his own <hi>Life</hi> alſo.</p>

               <p>Now old <hi>Ely</hi> was not againſt the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Women, who <hi>aſſembled</hi> by <hi>Troops,</hi> as (in the Margent of the <hi>Bible</hi>) you may ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.21, 22. though ſome Men now a days may be againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens <hi>Meetings</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-times, and againſt Woments <hi>Speaking</hi> or <hi>Prophecying,</hi> but they are ignorant of the univerſal <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of their <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and are of a narrow <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are not the true <hi>Servers</hi> of <hi>God</hi> themſelves; for if they were, they would have all People to ſerve God in his <hi>Power,</hi> and to keep the true <hi>Religion,</hi> which is <hi>to viſit the Fatherleſs</hi> and <hi>the Widows, and to keep themſelves from the Spots of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſome there have been, that would not have the Women to meet without the Men; and ſome of them ſay, the Women muſt not ſpeak in the <hi>Church,</hi> and if they muſt not ſpeak, what ſhould they meet with them for?</p>

               <p>Now, the Jews had their Aſſemblies of Mourning-women; and therefore the Prophet calls for the Mourning-women, <hi>and let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail,</hi> ſays he, when the Jews went into Tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>And this was becauſe the Men and Women were not Diligent in his Service, in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which he had poured upon them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſays, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, O ye Women! and let your Ears receive the Word of his Mouth, and teach your Daughters wailing, and every one their Neighbours Lamentation, Jer.</hi> 9.20.</p>
               <p>So, here the Prophet exhorts the Women, to hear the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> firſt, and then to teach and exhort their Daughters and Neighbours, yea Wailing and Lamentation.</p>
               <p>And were they not, and are they not, to teach their Families and their Neighbours from the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> both in the time of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to prevent Wailign and Lamentation.</p>

               <p>And ſo they are Partakers in the Goſpel, of the Deliverance over the <hi>Devil,</hi> the grand Enemy of Mankind: and are exhorted to praiſe the Lord, and to make Melody in their Hearts to the Lord, for their Salvation and Deliverance by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of the Goſpel, as well as the Men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.</p>

               <p>And in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. there <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lamented for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and all the Singing Men and Singing-Women ſpoke of <hi>Joſiah</hi> in their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
               <p>So here was not only Singing-Men, but Singing-Women, which did not only Sing but Lament for this good Man <hi>Joſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the days of <hi>Ezra,</hi> after the <hi>Jews</hi> returned from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to their Land, there were Two Hundred Singing-Men and Singign-Women, <hi>uEzra.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>So theſe were incouraged by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> according to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Order; and theſe were beſides the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, about Works and Services in the Holy Things; for theſe ſung <hi>Praiſes</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. he ſaith, <hi>Sing ye Daughters of</hi> Zion, <hi>ſhout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with all thy Heart, ye Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>the Lord hath taken away thy Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lord is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt ſee Evil no more.</hi>

               <p>And in <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. he encourageth them, to <hi>Sing and Rejoyce, Oh Daughter of</hi> Zion; <hi>for, lo I come, and I will dwell in the migſt of thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here is great cauſe for the Daghter of <hi>Zion</hi> to rejoyce; and who ſhall ſtop her Mouth?</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. you may ſee, how the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord appeared unto <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and what he ſaid to her, and what a Noble Veruous Mind was in her; and ſhe ſaid unto the Angel, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word;</hi> ſo her Belief was beyond <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s the Prieſt.</p>

               <p>So you may ſee her Belief was above <hi>Zachariah</hi>'s the Prieſt: So <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were notable Preachers of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you may ſee in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. how <hi>Mary</hi> wrapped <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Swadling-Cloaths, and how tender ſhe was of the Heavenly Birth, conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo muſt all true and tender <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that receive him in the Spirit, and how ſhe kept all the Sayings that were ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and pondered them in her Heart, ver. 19. And ſo ſhould every true <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there was <hi>Anna</hi> a Propheteſs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Annah</hi> ſpoke of Chriſt in the Temple.</note> which was Eighty Four Years old, who departed not from the <hi>Temple,</hi> but ſerved God with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer Night and Day, <hi>and ſhe gave thanks unto the Lord, and ſpoke of Chriſt unto all that looked for Redemption in</hi> Iſrael; ſhe ſpoke of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Here was a notable old Woman of Eighty Four Years of Age, a Preacher and Declarer of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:96751:195"/>
               <p>And you do not read that ever any deſpiſed her, or ſaid, it was forbidden for a Woman to ſpeak in the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Woman is ſet forth for an Examp;e to all Young and Old Women, of her Love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> her Saviour; and not only ſo, but a preacher of him to all that looked for Redemption in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> that came unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Lord help,</hi>

Great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So you may ſee, by this Woman's Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Daugher was made whole, which was an Example for all the Faithful to look unto Jeſus for Help, as you may ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Bounty and Humility of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </note> that took a Pound of <hi>Oinment</hi> of <hi>Spikenard,</hi> very coſtly, and anointed the Feet of Jeſus, and wiped his Feet with her Hair; and the whole Houſe was filled with the <hi>Odour</hi> of the <hi>Ointment:</hi> But when <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw it, he had Indignation, ſaying, <hi>What profit is this waſte?

Now this was <hi>Judas,</hi> which carried the Bag, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and many there are that carry the Bag now, that would not have their Wives nor the Women beſtow any thing upon Chriſt, nor his poor Followers.</p>
               <p>But Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Let her alone, why trouble you her? she hath wrought a good Work on me / for the Poor ye have with you always, and whenſoever ye will, ye may do them good, but me ye have not always; ſhe hath done what ſhe could; ſhe is come before hand to anoint my Body to my Burial. Verily I ſay unto you, whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached throughout the World, this alſo that ſhe hath done ſhall be ſpoken of, for a Memorial of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not forbid the Woman's Practice, but encouraged her, and ſo he doth ſtill, them that obey him.</p>
               <p>And the Woman that was Twelve Years troubled with an <hi>Iſſue</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> who had ſpent all upon <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and grew worſe and worſe; her Faith was ſo ſtrong, that ſhe believed, if ſhe could but touch the Hem of his Garment, ſhe ſhould be well.</p>
               <p>And as ſoon as ſhe had touched his Cloaths,<note place="margin">The Faith of the Woman Twelve Tears diſeaſed.</note> vertue went from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and healed her; and then the Woman came fearing and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and fell down before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and told him all the Truth, what ſhe had done; <hi>And he ſaid unto her, Daughter, thy Faith hath made thee whole, go in Peace,</hi> Mark 5.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> here ſufferedf a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſpeak before him, from whom ſhe had received the Healing-Vertue.</p>
               <p>And you may ſee when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was cruciſied, how many Women were there, as <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James,</hi> and many others which came up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that were about <hi>Jeſus</hi> at the time of his being crucified, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 15.</p>

                  <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>that he goeth beofe you into</hi> Galilee <hi>there ſhall you ſee him, as he ſaid unto you.</hi> For <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>John</hi> 20. it is ſaid, The two <hi>Angels</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mary, Woman, why weepeſt thou? And ſhe ſaid, becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him; and when ſhe had thus ſaid, ſhe turned her ſelf, and ſaw</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtanding, and knew not that it was</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>&amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>So here <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a Meſſenger of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

               <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. it's ſaid, It was <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Joanna,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James,</hi> and other Women which were with them, which told the Apoſtles, that <hi>Chriſt was riſen;</hi> and this was ſaid unto them, <hi>Why ſeek ye the Living among the Dead?

               <p>And they remembred theſe words, and they returned from the Sepulchre, and told all theſe things unto the Eleven Diſciples, and all the reſt.</p>

And he ſaid unto them, <hi>What things?</hi> And they ſaid unto him, <hi>Concerning</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>that was a great Prophet, and mighty in Deed and in Word, before God and all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the</hi> Jews <hi>have crucified; but they truſted he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and beſides all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done. And certain Women alſo of our Company made us aſtoniſhed, which were early at his Sepulchre; and when they found not is Body, they came, ſaying, That they bad ſeen a Viſion of Angels, which ſaid, he was alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here the Woman's Teſtimony of the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> aftoniſhed them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>O Fools, and ſlow of Heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken! Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his Glory,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:96751:196"/>
               <p>Now here you may ſee it was <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Joanna,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>James,</hi> and the other <hi>Women</hi> that were with them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the Eleven, which ſeemed but as idle Tales to the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And here was a joyful Woman's <hi>Meeting</hi> indeed,<note place="margin">Women ſpoke in the Church by Comiſſion from Chriſt, the Head of the Church.</note> of Meſſengers and Preachers of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, which is Recorded to Poſterity to their Renown, that all ſhould believe; though their Meſſage and Speech were as idle Tales to the Diſciples; but they were owned by <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head of the Church, as aforeſaid, though their Preaching was ſlighted by the Apoſtles, and counted as idle Tales; but they came to believe afterwards, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>And the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> convinced, and taught her how God was to be worſhipped, to wit, <hi>in the Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> you may ſee what a large diſcourſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had with her, as in <hi>John</hi> 4. from the 7th to the 27th, and ſuffered her to ſpeak before the Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples marvelled that he talked with a Woman; and the Woman left her Pitcher of Water,<note place="margin">The Woman a Preacher of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                  </note> and went away into a City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and ſaid unto the Men of the City (mark, unto the Men) <hi>Come and ſee a Man that told me all that ever I did, is not this the Chriſt?</hi> And many of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed becauſe of the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Woman, which teſtified, <hi>He told me all that ever I did.</hi> And when they heard <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſaid unto the Woman, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying only, but we have heard him our ſelves, and know that he is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here you may ſee, there was a Woman Preacher, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the Head of the Church) ſuffered; and through her means many were converted unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when they had crucified Jeſus Chriſt, there were many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that beheld him afar off, which followed him from <hi>Galilee,</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring unto him, amongſt which were <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Joſes</hi> the Mother of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s Children.</p>
               <p>And here you may ſee, there was a Woman's Meeting with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in his Sufferings, which when he was riſen, ſome of them preached his Reſurrection, as you may ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.61. and Chap. 28.5, 6, 7. where you may read the Meſſage <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave to the <hi>Women,</hi> to declare to the Apoſtles, as aforeſaid, which is recorded and ſet forth that others might believe their Meſſage.</p>
               <p>And when Chriſt ſpoke in Reproof to the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I tell you of a Truth, many Widows were in</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the days of</hi> Eliſha, <hi>&amp;c. but to none of them was</hi> Eliſha <hi>ſent, ſave to</hi> Zarephath, <hi>a City of</hi> Sidon, <hi>unto a Woman that was a Widow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Widow of <hi>Zarephath.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. And the Jews aroſe up, and thruſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of their City, being filled with Wrath againſt him, for this Saying, and his Reproving of them.</p>
               <p>And you may read at large the Acts, Doing and Sayings of this faithful Woman, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>Chriſt</hi> turned him to the Woman, and ſaid unto <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Seeſt thou this Woman:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Reproof upon Covetouſneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>I entred into thy Houſe, but thou gaveſt me no Water for my Feet; but ſhe hath waſhed my Feet with Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head: And thou gaveſt me no kiſs; but this Woman, ſince the time I came into the Houſe, hath not ceaſed to kiſs my
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:96751:196"/>Feet: My Head with Oil thou didſt not anoint; but this Woman hath anointed my Feet with Ointment: Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſins, which are many, are forgiven; for ſhe loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loved little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they that ſate at Meat with him began to ſay, <hi>Who is this that forgiveth Sins?</hi> and he ſaid unto the Woman, <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaved thee; go in Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here you may ſee how <hi>Chriſt</hi> juſtified the Woman's Actions above <hi>Simon,</hi> whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> ſaved her; which is chronicled to her Renown, and the Honour of God. And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. there you may ſee this <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> which was a Preacher of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it was ſhe,<note place="margin">The Charity of divers Women.</note> out of whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> had caſt ſeven Devils; and with her <hi>Joanna,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Chuſa, Herod</hi>'s Steward, and <hi>Suſanna,</hi> which miniſtred unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> of their Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Now, would not ſome Niggards be ready to ſay, Theſe Women pickt their Husbands Pockets; and others with <hi>Judas,</hi> who carry the Bag, may ſay, We muſt have but one Purſe, and is not our Gift and Benevolence ſufficient? as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>But his Woman loved <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>My mother and my Brethren are theſe, which hear the Word of God and do it,</hi> Luke 8.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Martha <hi>received Chriſt into her Honſe, and ſhe had a Siſter called</hi> Mary, <hi>that ſate at</hi> Jeſus<hi>'s Feet, and beard his Words;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The excellency of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Choice.</note> 
                  <hi>but</hi> Martha <hi>was cumbred about much ſerving; and</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaid unto her,</hi> Martha, <hi>thou art careing and troubled about many things, but one things is needful, and</hi> Mary <hi>hath choſen that good things, which ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> Which is the Duty of every good Man and Woman to do, if they will be kept out of the many things. And you may ſee how <hi>Mary</hi> talked with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> with her.</p>
               <p>So this is chronicled, that all might chuſe the <hi>Good Part,</hi> and the <hi>One Thing,</hi> which cannot be taken away from them; and to be kept out of the <hi>many things,</hi> that cumber, as you may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leven, which a Woman took and hid in three Meaſures of Meal, till all the Lump is levened?</hi> So, muſt not every Man and Woman know this <hi>Leven</hi> in their Hearts, if they will know the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt? Luke</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And the Parable of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> concerning the Woman that loſt her Piece of Silver, who lighted a Candle and ſwept her own Houſe, and found it in her own Houſe; and when ſhe had found it, ſhe rejoyced, and told her Neighbours. And muſt not every Woman light her own Candle at the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſweep her own Houſe with the <hi>Power</hi> of God, before ſhe finds God's Treaſure? And then for Joy that they have found it,<note place="margin">The Woman who found her loſt piece of Silver.</note> go and declare it unto their Friends and Neighbours? And do not all thoſe Women that have found this, preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> to their Friends and Neighbours, and call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For may they not be ſuffered after they have loſt an outward Treaſure, and found it again, to call their Neighbours together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with them, which they may find by lighting an outward Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? But their <hi>Spirits</hi> being the Candle of the Lord, this muſt be lighted at the Heavenly Light and Fire, by which their Everlaſting Treaſure is found; and muſt not they ſay then to their Neighbours and Friends, Rejoyce with me, for I have found the Piece which was
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96751:197"/>loſt? <hi>Likewiſe, I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>there is joy in the Preſence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth;</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Now, here you may ſee all theſe renowned, faithful Women, were encouraged by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Followers; and are recorded and ſet forth to encourage all that are faithful to wait upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to light their Candle at God's Light and Fire, that ſo they may ſweep their Houſe and find their Treaſure, that they may declare their Joy of it to their Friends and Neighbours.</p>
               <p>And alſo you may ſee <hi>Dorcas</hi> was full of good Works, and Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds which ſhe did:<note place="margin">Dorcas full of good Works.</note> 
                  <hi>And all the Widows ſtood by</hi> Peter <hi>weeping, ſhewing the Coats and Garments which</hi> Dorcas <hi>made, whilſt ſhe was with them,</hi> (<hi>to wit,</hi> the Widows:) Mark, and was not there a <hi>Womens-Meeting</hi> then? whilſt <hi>Dorcas</hi> was with them; <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Widows;</hi> and <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> was a Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus, Acts</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> on the Sabbath went out of the City by a River-ſide, where Prayers were wont to be made, and ſpoke to the Women which reſorted thither; and was not there a <hi>Womans-Meeting</hi> alſo, which reſorted there to pray together?</p>
               <p>And there was a certain Woman named <hi>Lydia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THe Feithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
                  </note> a Seller of Purple, of the City of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which worſhipped God, whoſe Heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the things ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſhe beſought him to come to her Houſe, if he judged her faithful to the Lord, and abide there, and ſhe conſtrained him and them that were with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. So you may ſee the Faithfulneſs of this Woman, and the Practice of the other Women before they were converted.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Priſcilla,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Priſcialla</hi> a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Goſpel.</note> which was a notable Faithful <hi>Woman,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> often mentions with her Husband <hi>Aquilla;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi>'s four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were Propheteſſes, which were ſet forth to encourage others. And you may ſee <hi>Phebe,</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſends his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Corinth</hi> by, and calls <hi>a Servant of the Church of</hi> Cenchrea; and he ſaith, <hi>Greet</hi> Mary, <hi>which beſtowed much Labour upon us; and</hi> Priſcilla <hi>and</hi> Aquilla, <hi>my Fellow-Labourers in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here you may ſee there were <hi>Women</hi> Labourers and Helpers in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">With other Women Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</note> And he farther ſaith, <hi>I commend unto you our Siſter</hi> Phebe, <hi>Who is a Servant unto the Church,</hi> &amp;c. And ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Priſcilla <hi>and</hi> Aquilla, <hi>my Fellow-helpers in Chriſt Jeſus, which for my Life have laid down their Necks, unto whom not only I give Thanks, but alſo all the Churches of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here you may ſee in what eſteem was this <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> and <hi>Phebe,</hi> and other <hi>Women</hi> for their Faithfulneſs to the Churches; as you may read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the unbelieving Wife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>elſe their Children were unholy;</hi> but now they are clean; and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the believing Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: So here is an equal ſhare in the Belief, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, That <hi>every Woman that prayeth or propheſieth with her Head uncovered, diſhonoureth her Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:96751:197"/>
               <p>So <hi>Women</hi> may Pray and Propheſie here, according to Order, in the Church, as well as the Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And yet the ſame Apoſtle in the 14th Chapter, forbids a <hi>Woman</hi> to ſpeak in the Church.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the Women keep Silence in the Church;</hi> and if they will learn any thing, <hi>let them ask their Husbands at home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when they have learnt of <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Husband at home,<note place="margin">What ſort of Women forbid to ſpeak in the Church.</note> they are not forbididen of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from Propheſying or Praying; but to lie babbling and prating in the Church, ſuch Speaking in the Church is a Shame.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Widow</hi> hath no Husband to ask but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> nor a <hi>Virgin,</hi> yet ſhe may Propheſie; and a believing <hi>Woman,</hi> that hath an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Husband, he is to be ſanctified by her: So ſhe is not to learn her Salvation of him, but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to do his work.</p>
               <p>And the ſame <hi>Apoſtle ſaith, Let the Men keep Silence in the Church, if they ſpeak in an unknown Tongue, and there be not an Interpreter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, here the Men muſt keep Silence in the Church in this caſe,<note place="margin">Men forbid in ſome Caſes to ſpeak in the Church, as well as ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> as well as the Women, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.27.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> further ſaith, <hi>I permit not a Woman to ſpeak in the Church, but to be under Obedience; as alſo ſaith the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' the <hi>Law</hi> did not permit their <hi>uſurping Authority</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it did permit their Propheſying in the Church, in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as in the time of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> as you may ſee by thoſe Famous Women before-mentioned, in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as well as in the <hi>New.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>I beſeech thee,</hi> Euodias, <hi>and I beſeech</hi> Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyche, <hi>that they may be of the ſame mind in the Lord; and I intreat thee alſo, true Yoke-Fellow, help thoſe Women which laboured with me in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; with</hi> Clement <hi>alſo, und iwth other my Fellow Labourers, whoſe Names are in the Book of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intreated his Yoke-Fellow to help thoſe Women which laboured with him in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (the <hi>Power</hi> of God:) So theſe Women were meet Helps with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the Labour of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> (the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) as you may ſee in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. And all that be of his <hi>Mind</hi> in the Lord, will encourage either <hi>Women</hi> or <hi>Widows,</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> that have received the Goſpel, to labour in it; and all that have not the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the Lord, will diſcourage <hi>Womens</hi> labouring in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and not entreat others to help them; but ſuch will give them Liberty to labour in the <hi>Power</hi> of Darkneſs, and to Slothfulneſs, and Careleſneſs; which the Wo is unto, and not the Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>And again, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>the Women ſhould adorn themſelves in modeſt Apparrel, and Shamefacedneſs, and Sobriety, not with broidered Hair, or Gold or Pearls, or coſtly Array, but which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Women profeſſing Godlineſs, with good Works; and let your Women learn in Silence with all Subjection,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I ſuffer not a Woman to teach nor to uſurp Authority over the Man; but learn in Silence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Woman being deceived, was firſt in Tranſgreſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for a Woman to Preach or Teach, ſuch a Teaching as <hi>Eve</hi> taught <hi>Adam,</hi> ſuch a Sermon as ſhe had from the Serpent, that drew her ſelf, and <hi>Adam</hi> her Husband, from God's Teaching; here, in this Teaching, ſhe uſurp'd Authority over the Man; and therefore God
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96751:198"/>ſe the Man to rule over the Woman; but they were meet helps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while they were under God's Teaching.</p>
               <p>Now, to uſurp Authority over the Man by ſuch Teaching, is out of the Unity; which Teaching is forbidden both by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and they are not fit to Teach, if they have not learn'd Subjection to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, and know the Silence of all Fleſh before the Lord, and have not learn'd to adorn themſelves with that which is modeſt, and the Leſſon of Sobriety, whith becomes Godlineſs; and with the good Works, the Fruits of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>And ſuch Women as have learn'd this Leſſon may Teach and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; for the <hi>Spirit</hi> is poured upon them to that End.</p>
               <p>And the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Elder Women, Nurſes, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Church of Chriſt,</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. That <hi>the Women ſhould be as Mothers;</hi> and a Mother is a Nurſer, and a Teacher, and Inſtructer of her Children; and <hi>the younger Women as Siſters, with all Purity;</hi> and Siſters in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and in <hi>Purity,</hi> all have but one Father; and a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is in the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And again, The Apoſtle writes to <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſaith unto him, <hi>Speak thou the things which become ſound Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The aged Women, that they be of good behaviour, as becometh Holineſs; not falſe Accuſers, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to much Wine; teachers of good things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here they muſt be qualified before they can be Teachers of thoſe good things.</p>
               <p>And that theſe aged <hi>Women</hi> teach the younger <hi>Women;</hi> firſt, <hi>To be Sober;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>To love their Husbands;</hi> thirdly, <hi>To love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> fourthly, <hi>To be Diſcreet;</hi> fifthly, <hi>To be Chaſte, and keepers at home, and Good, Obedient to their own Husbands, that the Word of God be not blaſphemed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here the aged <hi>Women,</hi> not a <hi>Woman,</hi> but the aged <hi>Women,</hi> were to teach the younger <hi>Women</hi> theſe things.</p>

               <p>And therefore the Believing Women being Heirs of Grace and Life, as well as the Men, they may impart of their Life, which they do inherit, as well as Men; for an Heir of Life is beyond an Heir of the Earth.</p>

               <p>But there are many Idle Talkers, and Buſie Bodies, that are out of the Senſe and Service of God, that will not do good themſelves, nor ſuffer others to do their Service of Love and Charity for the Lord in the Church.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> writes in his <hi>Second Epiſtle</hi> unto the <hi>Elect Lady</hi> and her Chidlren, <hi>whom I love in the Truth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and not I only,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſtretcheth forth her hands to the Poor; yea, ſhe reacheth forth her hands to the Needy,</hi> Prov. 31. And muſt ſhe not then have ſomething of the Outward to do it withal?</p>

                  <hi>She opens her Mouth in Wiſdom, and in her Tongue is the Law of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: She looks well to the Ways of her Houſhold, and eateth not the Bread of Idleneſs: She is like the Merchant's Shir, ſhe bringeth her Food from

               <p>And here is an Example to all <hi>Women,</hi> a Pattern of Vertue, and of Fruitfulneſs, and Faithfulneſs, and Valour, and Practice in the Lord's <hi>Work;</hi> and ſuch their Children will riſe up, and call her <hi>bleſſed.

               <p>And now <hi>Friends,</hi> many of other Examples in the Scriptures might be ſhewed, to encourage <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> in the Service of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both concerning their Faithful Teſtimony for the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their Encouragement by the Faithful in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> how that they had their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> and their <hi>Meetings;</hi> and now they being Heirs of <hi>Life,</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> you may ſee over him that has darkned you, and before he was.</p>

Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? was not my Soul grieved for the Poor? <hi>Now, here ye may all ſee the Actions and Practice of this Man, by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing the pure Religion: So it is not a Talk, but a walking in it; as you may ſee in</hi> Job 30, 31 <hi>Chapters.</hi>

                  <hi>Now, all you that profeſs God and Chriſt, ſee how you walk in the Steps of theſe good Men and Women; and not only to talk as they did, but do and practiſe as they did; for it is not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Kingdom, but be that doth what he commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>So you may ſee how theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> high and low, were gone from <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Law,</hi> and his <hi>Command,</hi> by hearkning to, and obeying this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which had led <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to diſobey <hi>God</hi>'s Command; and therefore they would not receive his <hi>Son,</hi> nor his <hi>Order,</hi> nor <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And what became of all theſe <hi>Jews?</hi> was not their City laid waſte, and they ſcattered over all Nations, and they deſtroyed of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer,</hi> who had denied <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Saviour, that wept over them, and would have ſaved them from Deſtruction?</p>
               <p>And ſuch as came to <hi>John,</hi> and was baptized by him, and rejoyced in his <hi>Light</hi> for a ſeaſon, and many that followed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſaid he

               <p>And the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> is riſen now,<note place="margin">The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that roſe againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles is riſen now.</note> that roſe againſt the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as you may ſee in their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> in the <hi>Romans, Corinthians,</hi> and in <hi>Peter, Timothy, Titus, Jude</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Some got the Form of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and denied the <hi>Power;</hi> and ſome were Enemies to the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> others were getting another <hi>Goſpel</hi> than the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which brought them under the Curſe; others were ſpeaking the things of <hi>God,</hi> in the Words that Man's <hi>Wiſdom</hi> taught them; others their <hi>Faith</hi> was ſtanding in <hi>Words,</hi> and not in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> others their <hi>Faith</hi> was ſtanding in <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollo's,</hi> which ſhould have ſtood in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Which grieved the Apoſtles, for their <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould have ſtood in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they preached: Others with good Words and fair Speeches deceived the Hearts of the Simple.</p>
               <p>And therefore, all they which preach'd <hi>Faith,</hi> and made ſhipwrack of <hi>Faith,</hi> was, and are ſtill denied: And all ſuch as preach <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and crucifies <hi>Chriſt</hi> to themſelves afreſh, and denies <hi>God</hi> in their Works, were then, and are denied. And all ſuch as preach the <hi>Light,</hi> and walk in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and preach the <hi>Spirit</hi> (the <hi>Fruits</hi> of which is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi>) and are in <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Enmity,</hi> were never owned by <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor good <hi>Men,</hi> though they may be called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And all ſuch as preach <hi>Liberty,</hi> and themſelves were Servants of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, were, and are ſtill denied.

               </p>
               <p>And all ſuch as preach the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and are not doers of the Word, they are Deceivers of their own Souls, and they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others with the good <hi>Words:</hi> And ſuch cannot be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>God,</hi> neither can they bring others to Reconciliation with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this <hi>Spirit</hi> is but <hi>One;</hi> which <hi>Spirit</hi> all along has wrought againſt the <hi>true Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all his People: and was in Srife, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and Diſquietneſs againſt the Righteous in all Ages; but it wrought its own Deſtruction and the Fall of them that followed it; as you may ſee, through all the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>And ſo <hi>dear Friends,</hi> let the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is ſhed abroad in your Hearts, caſt out all Fear: And keep in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in which you are gathered, which is above every Name under the whole Heaven, in whom you have <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and his Preſence among you; whoſe <hi>Name</hi> is a <hi>Strong Tower;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Rock</hi> to hide your ſelves in, and his <hi>Spirit</hi> to cover you, which is a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient enough for you; <hi>and Wo will be to that Spirit which is covered, but not with his Spirit;</hi> they may fly to the Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to cover and hide them,<note place="margin">No help in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>And therefore truſt in the Lord, who has preſerved you by his Glorious Light and Power to this day, that you may be ſettled upon the Seed <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which is over all <hi>that,</hi> within and without, that is contrary to it, and bruiſeth the Head of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that hath been between you and God: So that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Seed you have Peace with the Lord God, Life, and Dominion, and Election, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who Redeems out of the Curſe, and Fear of Men, or that makes the <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> his ſtrength, and not the <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore the Arm of the Lord being your Strength, Chriſt your Rock and Salvation, then you need not fear what Man can do unto you; for all God's Children are dear and tender to him, whom he hath begotten again by the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to be Heirs of his Kingdom, he feeds them with Life Eternal, and the Milk of his Word, which Word lives, and abides, and endures for ever, and is always full and plentious of Milk to nurſe and nouriſh all God's Children unto Eternal Life, and to inherit his Kingdom, and the World which is Everlaſting, which Chriſt is the Ruler of (the heavenly and ſpiritual Man) and therefore they that are in him, muſt be <hi>New Creatures;</hi> for all the <hi>Old Creatures</hi> are in <hi>old Adam.</hi>

               <p>And the Lord God Almighty ſtrengthen you in your inward Man, and over all give you Dominion in the Seed of Life, which bruiſeth the Head of the <hi>Serpent</hi> (tht brought Death and a Curſe) and this <hi>Seed</hi> bringeth the Bleſſings, in which all Nations are bleſſed; and out of this <hi>Seed</hi> they are not bleſſed, though they may profeſs all the words of this good <hi>Seed;</hi> and if they are not in it, they have not the Bleſſing in it; and they that be in this, their Bleſſings and Peace flow as a River from the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> that ſtandeth ſure, which all the <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>ſanctiſied Ones</hi> did and do build upon, who is their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And my Deſire is, that you (in your Meaſures) may be preſerved to the Lord,<note place="margin">Love Mercy, and do Juſtly.</note> and know what he doth require of you, <hi>to love Mercy, to do Juſtice, and to walk Humbly with God;</hi> for the more he giveth,

                  <note place="margin">And to ſpeak to him that hath Offended alone.</note> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thy Brother treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone; if he ſhould hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes every Word may be eſtabliſhed: And if he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Publican. Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever is bound on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven:</hi> And farther Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If two of you ſhall agree on Earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven: For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18.

                  </note> So much more the Believers in Chriſt in the New Teſtament, in the time of the Goſpel, are to have their Aſſemblies and Meetings; beſides their Inſtructing and looking into their own Families, whether they walk in the Fear of God: And then after, in the General Service of the Church of God, the aged Men, and aged Women in the Truth are to be <hi>Teachers of good things,</hi> as the Lord ſhall order them with his Spirit, to Teach and Inſtruct, Exhort, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, Reprove, Rebuke with the Holy Spirit;<note place="margin">And to rebuke and reprove in the holy Spirit.</note> for the leaſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hath an Office, and every Believer in the Light (which is the Life in Chriſt) is a Member of Chriſt's Church, and grafted into him; and ſo he is the holy Head of the Church, and they are Heirs of his Order, and of his Government, of the Increaſe of which there is no end, in his Eternal Power and Spirit.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their Days, they had to do with ſeveral ſorts of People, ſome that preached Chriſt of Envy, and ſome of Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſome of Good-will, notwithſtanding the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> rejoyced that Chriſt was preached. But then after a time, when many had gotten the Form of Chriſtianity and Godlineſs, and denied the Power thereof, he exhorted the Faithful, that kept their Habitation in Chriſt Jeſus, to turn away from ſuch.</p>
               <p>And yet ſuch went under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> elſe they could not have the Form of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe,<note place="margin">Such as have the form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power of it, are to be turned away.</note> ſuch as got the good <hi>Words</hi> and fair <hi>Speeches,</hi> with which they deceived the Hearts of the Simple, theſe were got to be Preachers among the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And the heady, high-minded and fierce <hi>Deſpiſers,</hi> theſe had the Form of Godlineſs, though they denied the Power of it, which they were turned from.</p>
               <p>So they that lived in the Light, Grace and Truth, and the Power and Spirit of Chriſt, were to turn away from ſuch, that had the Form of Godlineſs, and denied the Power.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as theſe, that had the Form of Godlineſs and denied the Power, were come farther than ſuch as taught for <hi>Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of the World, and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> or the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſtood againſt the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt, which were altogether Unbelievers of the very Form of Godlineſs of the New Covenant.</p>

               <p>And thoſe that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> cried againſt, that were come ſo far as <hi>Balaam</hi> to Propheſie, and <hi>Cain</hi> to hear the Voice of <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Corah,</hi>

               <p>And ſuch-like as theſe were they, that ſeparated themſelves, being ſenſual, having not the Spirit. And ſo it ſeems theſe did ſet up Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Saints in their Days.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> declareth, how <hi>the Lord ſaved his People out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and afterwards deſtroyed them that believed not;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And ſo theſe, which went under the Name of Chriſtians, that had been convinced, and had got a Form of Godlineſs and Chriſtianity, that kept not their firſt State, in the Light, and Grace and Truth, and by it, their Habitation in Chriſt Jeſus, they came under the Chain of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, <hi>Friends,</hi> you ſee how the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was troubled with the <hi>falſe Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi>'s <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> that got among the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and how they deſpiſed the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likewiſe what was got up among the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and in the Days of <hi>John,</hi> as he manifeſts in his <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, how Careful were the <hi>true Apoſtles,</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> in their Watching over them!</p>
               <p>For <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>If ye walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, then have we Fellowſhip one with another. And that ye alſo may have Fellowſhip with us; for truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe things write we unto you, that your Joy may be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For many may talk of the <hi>Light,</hi> and preach the <hi>Light;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thoſe that walk in the Light are accepted.</note> but to walk in the <hi>Light;</hi> that is it which grafts into Chriſt Jeſus, and brings to live in him, which talking of him doth not.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid, <hi>As every one hath received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk in him. And the Sayers of the Word, and not the Doers, deceived their own Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there may be many Sayers of the <hi>Word,</hi> deceivers of their own Souls and others, and Preachers of Chriſt Jeſus. But the Doers of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the Walkers in Chriſt Jeſus, are they that are accepted of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And again, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word of Faith was nigh them, in their Hearts and Mouths, to obey it and do it; and that was the Word of Faith which they preached.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Light ſhined in their Hearts, to give them the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the anointing which you have received of him, abideth in you; and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things, that is true, and is no Lye; and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him. And theſe things I have written unto you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>concerning them that ſeduce you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here may all the inward Chriſtians in the Grace, Light, Truth, Power and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, ſee what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Saints</hi> unto, that they might be preſerved in their Day,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:96751:226"/>and ſo by the ſme now, from them that deceived their own Souls and othes.</p>
               <p>And ſo by this <hi>Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Anointing the Saiats Guide.</note> this <hi>Word,</hi> the Anointing, Grace, Truth, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt in the Heart, Mind and Soul, muſt all the <hi>Saints</hi> be guided now, by which they may come to be inward Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and have a Habitation in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo built upon Him the Living Rock and Roundation, as the <hi>Saints</hi> were in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Days; and ſo to have <hi>Salt</hi> in your ſelves, and the <hi>Leaven</hi> in your own Meal, and the <hi>Pearl</hi> in your own Field, and yuor <hi>Lamps</hi> lighted in your own Tabernacles, and nouriſhed with the heavenly Oil. So that you may put a Difference betwixt the Clean and the Unclean, and what you are to touch, and whaat you are not. And that no <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> may look below Heaven for their Bread, tonouriſh their Souls and inward Man, and below God and Chriſt for their Springs, which by continuing in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in Chriſt, the <hi>Word,</hi> by which all things were made and created, they ſhall have a Spring from him the Fountain, ſpringing up in them to <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> ſo they ſhall have both the upper and nether Springs to nouriſh the <hi>Plant</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath planted.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after rebelled againſt the Lord, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law and the Prophets, were a greater Grief, to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets than the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And likewiſe,<note place="margin">Apoſtates both under the Law and the Goſpel the greateſt Exerciſes to the Servants of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </note> thoſe that came to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (called) and had got the Form of Godlineſs, came to be a greater Grief to the Apoſtles than the World; for their Work was to ſeek to deſtroy that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had begotten, and them that they had turned to Chriſt. And therefore well might the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhort the Saints, <hi>to turn away from ſuch, that had the Form of Godlineſs, and denied the Power;</hi> and therefore he told the Saints, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſtands not in Words, but in Power;</hi> and therefore they were to know one another in the Spirit and Power; and that is the <hi>Internal Knowledge:</hi> And their Fellowſhip was to be in the Holy Ghoſt, and their Unity in the Spirit, which was the Bond of Peace; and their Fellowſhip was to be inthe <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which was the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> So an Everlaſting Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Everlaſting <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that will out-laſt the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> for it was before it was. And alſo, their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> was to be in the precious <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which Chriſt was the Author and Finiſher of; the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of which was held in a pure Conſcience; and their Worſhip was in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi> So you may ſee what a Heavenly Unity and Fellowſhip, and a Worſhip Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſet up.</p>
               <p>And the Saints in the Light, Grace, Truth, Spirit and the Power of God the Goſpel, lived in it, and walked in it. So with the Light, Grace, Truth, Power, Spirit and Word of Life in the Heart, all hold Chriſt the Head, who is the Head of all thigs, by whom all things were made, who is the Treaſure of the heavenly ſaving Wiſdom and Knowledge, who is called the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore all are to have their Knowledge and their Wiſdom from him the Treaſure, by the Light, Grace, Truth, Power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit that comes from him, it leads you to him your Treaſure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

               <p>And in this <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the Saints Fellowſhip, which the <hi>Devil</hi> with all his falſe Fellowſhips cannot get into, nor find it;<note place="margin">True Liberty in the Faith of Chriſt.</note> for it is a <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Likewiſe, true Liberty is in the <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Author and Finiſher of, which gives <hi>Victory</hi> over that which ſeparated <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and by which they have acceſs to <hi>God</hi> again. And in this holy, pure, divine, precious <hi>Faith,</hi> that is held in the pure Conſcience; which pure Conſcience hath its pure, holy, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, precious Liberty, in this holy, divine, precious <hi>Faith,</hi> which works by <hi>Love</hi> (and not as the dead <hi>Faith</hi> doth, which works by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>) which is the <hi>Fruit</hi> of this holy, pure, divine <hi>Faith;</hi> and in it is the divine, pure, holy and precious <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi> So here is the divine, holy, pure and precious <hi>Liberty</hi> in this <hi>Faith,</hi> which works by <hi>Love,</hi> that is the <hi>Victory</hi> over that which brought <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> into Bondage, and Slavery, and falſe Liberty.<note place="margin">Faith is the Saints victory.</note> So this living <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Victory</hi> over all dead <hi>Faiths</hi> and <hi>falſe Freedoms</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> which holy, divine, pure and precious <hi>Faiths</hi> the Saints were and are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Holy One</hi> is the Author and Finiſher of: So in this holy, divine, pure and precious <hi>Faith,</hi> they have a holy, divine, pure and precious <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is the <hi>Victory</hi> over the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> and the <hi>Adverſary,</hi> the <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> and all this Inſtruments; and they cannot come within this holy, divine, pure and precious <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is in the <hi>Faith;</hi> for it is a <hi>Myſteryj;</hi> and gives <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> over him, and the acceſs to the pure <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; which all are too ſtand faſt in that <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made them free, who is the heavenly and ſpiritual <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Bondaged, Captivity and Thraldom, falſe Freedom and falſe Liberty was and is in <hi>Old Adam,</hi> in Tranſgreſſion; and the true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is that, which Chriſt the pure and holy One makes free in; and this is a pure holy Liberty, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes, and ſets his People free in; in which they are all to ſtand faſt over all the falſe Liberties and Freedoms, which are Bondage.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the true Libertyis in the <hi>Truth,</hi> which <hi>if the Truth hath made you free, then are you free indeed, from him that abode not in the Truth, in whom there is no Truth.</hi> So then there is no true Freedom nor Liberty in him; and he in whom there is no Truth, cannot come into this Freedom and Liberty, which is in the Truth, but remains in the Falſe.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> in the days of Chriſt, boaſted of their liberty and Freedom, though they were in Bondange both inwardly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that <hi>they were of</hi> Abraham <hi>their Father;</hi> but Chriſt told them, <hi>The Devil was their Father, and his luſts ye will do.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="444" facs="tcp:96751:227"/>
               <p>And alſo in the Days of the Apoſtles, many of the falſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> boaſted of their Liberty; but who was overcome by them was brought into Bondage.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle was ſo careful of his Liberty in Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">To be careful of our I iberty in Chriſt.</note> that ſuch as came to ſpie it out, and were ſomewhat in Conferrence; but they added nothing to him; and unto ſuch he would not give place by Subjection, but rather reproved them; and directed every one to walk according to the meaſure of the Rule which God hath diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them.</p>
               <p>And alſo <hi>true Liberty</hi> is inthe <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> which comes by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which by believig in te Light, they are grafted into Chriſt, and ſo into true Liberty and Freedom, and ſo are entred into the Reſt, out of the Toil of old <hi>Adam;</hi> for they are grafted into him, who was befor old <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Unbelievers in the Light are grafted into old <hi>Adam,</hi> in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And the Believers in the Light (which is the Life in Chriſt) are grafted into Chriſt the Word, by which all things were made and created. So here is perfect, true Freedom and Liberty.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe, the true Liberty and Freedom is in the Grace, which brings Salvation, and not Deſtruction; and teaches to live Godly, not Ungodly; and Soberly, not Unſoberly; and Righteouſly, not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly; and teaches to deny the World, and not to cleave to it, and follow it.</p>
               <p>This Grace eſtabliſhes the Heart, and ſeaſons the Words; the Fruits of its Liberty and Freedom will manifeſt it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And alſo, the true Liberty in the pure Holy Spirit of God and Chriſt doth Baptize and Plunge down that which is gotten up by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in Man and Woman, and circumciſes and cuts off the Body of Death and Sin in the Fleſh, that is gotten up in Man and Woman by Tranſgreſſion, and mortifies and kills that which would grieve, vex or quench the Motions of the pure Spirit of God; ſo that in this holy pure Spirit, of this pure God and Chriſt, is the holy pure Freedom and Liberty over all Bondage and falſe Liberties and Freedoms.</p>
               <p>And the Fruits of this pure Spirit is pure Love, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs,<note place="margin">Fruits of the Spirit.</note> Patience, Temperance and Humility; by which Spirit all are made to drink into one Spirit; ſo that all are the living Wells, that have their living Water from God and Chriſt, their true and living Fountain; and in which Spirit they have a holy and ſpiritual Fellowſhip, in this Baptizing, Mortifying, Circumciſig Spirit, yea, one wit another, and with the Son and the Father alſo, through which the Love of God warms every one's Heart: But when the <hi>Love of many waxes cold,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, then they go from this <hi>Grace, Ligth, Truth, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Anointing,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God in their own Hearts;</hi> then ſuch turn to be Betrayers, and not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours upon Mount <hi>Zion: And againſt ſuch God's ſwift Judgment turns, and ſuddenly falls, though they may cry for a time,</hi> Liberty, Freedom, <hi>and</hi> Peace, Peace; <hi>but a Day</hi> of trouble will overtake them ere they are aware.</p>
               <p>And therefore all ye Friends of Chriſt Jeſus, ſtand faſt in that <hi>Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free,</hi> by his Light, Grace, Truth, Spirit, Faith and Everlaſting Goſpel, the Everlaſting Power of God, which is an Everlaſting Freedom and Liberty above all Bondage and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96751:227"/>falſe fallen Liberties and Freedoms; in this glorious Goſpel, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious joyful Libert, where all may exerciſe God and Chriſt's Holy Gifts in his Holy Supernatural Light, Grace, Truth, Spirit, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, and Word of Life, and the Goſpel; which Word cannot be bound with all the World's Cords or Chains; <hi>For it is a Fire to burn, and a Hammer to break, and a Sword to cut in pieces;</hi> and therefore love the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>keep the Word of Patience, and the Lord will keep you</hi> (for it is a tried <hi>Word,</hi> and it will keep you) <hi>in all trials, which ſhall come upon all the World to try them:</hi> For the Word was before the World was, and will be when the World is gone, which all the new-born Babes of the Incorruptible Seed, who partake of the Milk of the Word, grow by it up into an Immortal Life, and Kingdom that is without End; <hi>Glory and Praiſes to the Lord God for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ye Babes of Chriſt, If the World do hate you, it hated Chriſt your Lord and Maſter alſo; if they do mock, and reproach, and defame, and buffet you, they did ſo to your Lord ad Maſter alſo; who was and is the Green Tree, that gives nouriſhment to all his Branches, his Followers.</p>
               <p>Now if the World do Perſecute you, and take away your Goods or Cloaths, was not your Lord and Maſter ſo ſerved?<note place="margin">Chriſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, mocked and crucified for us.</note> Did not they caſt Lots for his Garments? Was not he haled from the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and before <hi>Pontius pilate,</hi> and ſpit upon? And if they hate thee, and ſpit upon thee, he was hated and ſpit upon for thee: Did he not go to Priſon for thee? And was he not mocked and ſcourged for thee? Did not he bow to the Croſs and Grave for thee, he <hi>who had no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth?</hi> And did he not bear they Sins in his own Body upon the Tree? And was he not ſcourged for thee, <hi>by whoſe Stripes we are healed?</hi> Did not he ſuffer the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio of Sinners, who died for Sinners, and went into the Grave for Sinners, and died for the Ungodly, yea, taſted Death for every Man, who through Death deſtroyed <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and is <hi>riſen?</hi> For Death and the Grave could not hold him, nor the Powers and Principalities,<note place="margin">Death could not hold Chriſt in the <hi>Grave.</hi>
                  </note> with all their Guards and Watches, could not hold him within the Grave; but he is riſen, and is aſcended far above all Principalities, Powers, Thrones and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and is ſet down at the Right Hand of God, and remaineth in the Heavens till all things be reſtored: And he is reſtorign with his Light, Grace, Truth, Power, Spirit, Faith, Goſpel, and Word of Life; ſo that you read of ſome, <hi>that came to ſit together in Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore all muſt bow at the Name of Jeſus their Saviou, in his Light, Grace, Truth, Power, Spirit and Goſpel (for he hath bowed for you) if you riſe with him; and you muſt ſuffer with him, if you will reign with him; and die with him, if you will live with him: And all that are dead and buried with Chriſt, and are riſen with him, they will ſeek thoſe things that come down from above, where Chriſt ſits at the Right Hand of God; and there you will ſeek thoſe things which come down from above and not things which are below.</p>
               <p>For thoſe which ſeek thoſe things that are below, are the Talkers of God and Chriſt, and the Prophets and Apoſtles words, but they
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:96751:228"/>are not dead with Chriſt, nor riſen with him; and therefore they do not ſeek thoſe things that come down from Heaven, where Chriſt ſits at the Right Hand of God. But they are them that ſeek the things that are above,<note place="margin">To ſeck thoſe things which are above.</note> that are dead with Chriſt, and riſen with him; they, I ſay, do ſeek thoſe things which come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Chriſt ſits at the Right Hand of God; and they have not only ſought them, but have found them, and received them, and come to ſit together in Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus, a ſafe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and heavenly ſitting in the heavenly Reſt and Habitation in Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Firſt and Laſt, and over all, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting: <hi>Bleſſings and Praiſes over all be to the Lord God through him for ever,</hi> Amen.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>God</hi> of Order.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Eternal Living God of Truth, he is a God of Order, and is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace in all the Chruches of the Saints.</p>
               <p>Now the Author of Confuſion, and not of Peace, is the God of the World, who abode not in the Truth, becauſe there is no Truth in him; <hi>and when he ſpeaks a Lie, he ſpeaks of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Jews,</hi> which did the God of the World's Luſts, and them called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that do, were in Strife, Confuſion and Diſorder.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews,</hi> they went out of the Order of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>oſes,</hi> going from the Spirit of God poured out upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo went from the Lord, and his Law, into Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which the living God of Truth was not the Author of.</p>
               <p>Alſo the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who go from te Light, Grace, Truth, Power, Spirit, Goſpel and Faith, which Chriſt Jeſus is the Author of, they go from Chriſt and his Order, who was not madee a Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who <hi>was without beginning of Days, or end of Life;</hi> an Everlaſting Order.</p>
               <p>And ſuch go into Strife and Confuſion that go from Chriſt, which Chriſt and God is not the Author of, but the World's God, who got into Man and Woman by Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God; who is the Author of Confuſion, Strife and Diſorder, in whom there is no Truth. For what Order can there be in the World's God, and amongſt his Subjects, in whom there is no Truth? For in whom there is no Truth, there is no true Order; and they that abide not in the Truth, Grace, Light, Spirit, Goſpel, Faith, and Word of Life, they abide not in the Order of God and Chriſt</p>
               <p>And ſuch will cry againſt the Order of the Truth, Light, Grace, Spirit, Goſpel, Faith, and Word of Life, which bring into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chriſt, and the Order of the Living Eternal God of Truth, who is a <hi>God</hi> of Order, and delights in Order, having Pleaſure in them that live in his Sprit, and Law of Life, and the Goſpel, and its Order: For <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that delights in the Law, or Order, of God;</hi> it was ſo under the Old Covenant: Much more <hi>Bleſſed is the Man or Woman that delights in the Law and Order of Love,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And none keep the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but who keep in the <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Author of, which wourks by <hi>Love.</hi> And none keep the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96751:228"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> but who keep in the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and walk in it, which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the heavenly and ſpiritual <hi>Second Andam,</hi> who was before old <hi>Adam,</hi> who under the <hi>World's God,</hi> out of Truth, in whom there is no Truth, nor true Order, but Confuſion and Diſorder.</p>
               <p>And therefore all who come to <hi>God,</hi> who is a <hi>God</hi> of Order, muſt come bythe <hi>Grace, Truth, Light, Power, Goſpel, Faith</hi> and <hi>Anoitnting,</hi> the <hi>Word of Life within;</hi> and ſuch come to love the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to delight in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Order. So you may ſee, that <hi>God is a God of Order,</hi> who called <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they had an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> had an Order; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is after his Everlaſting Order.<note place="margin">Chriſt'r King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> hath an Everlaſting Kingdom, that ſtands in Everlaſing Righteouſneſs, and Power and Joy in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yea, an eſtableſhed Kingdom, that will never have an end, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be broken; and no imperfect, defiled nor corruptible thind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into is.</p>
               <p>And all <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>'s Subjects of his Everlaſting Kingdom, that ſee it, and enter into it, are born again (not of the Will of Man) but of an Incorruptible Seed, by the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and have the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Milk of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which the grow from <hi>Babes</hi> to <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and have the <hi>Fine Linnen,</hi> the <hi>Incorruptible Cloathing,</hi> the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Linnen,</hi> which they do wear in <hi>Chriſts Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So all <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Subjects of his Kingdom are known by their Birth and Cloathing, and live in the Order of hiw <hi>Goſpel of Love, Lifew, Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and no Man comes into his Kingdom and Order, but by the <hi>Light, Grace, Truth, Faith, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Anointing,</hi> and <hi>Word of Life within,</hi> through which they know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> that ſtands in <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and by ti keep in the Order of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> whcih they have in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>Here you may ſee by theſe following <hi>Scriptures,</hi> how the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> loved the Good and holy Order of Chriſt in his Goſpel,<note place="margin">Some Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning good Order in the Church.</note> and Light, and Life and Truth; but as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Land of Darkneſe is without any Order.</hi> And <hi>Babylon</hi> ſignifies <hi>Confuſion,</hi> which is the falſe Church, and is called a <hi>Woman,</hi> and <hi>a City of Confuſion,</hi> who iw againſt the Order of the true Church, and gets the Titles of the true Chruch that is called a <hi>City,</hi> and a <hi>Woman, which brings forth the Man-Child, Chriſt Jeſus; and of the increaſe of his Government and peace there ſhall be no end; who ſits upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and upon his dom, to order it, to eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice, henceforth and for ever.</hi> So here you may ſee Chriſt doth in his Kingdom; and them that have him, have his Order. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Although mine Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all thins, and ſure; for this is all my Salvation, and all my Deſire,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Order my ſteps by thy Word, and let not Iniquity have Dominion over me,</hi> Pſalm 119.133.</p>
               <p>Which is the Duty of every Chriſtian, to have their Steps ordered by the Word of <hi>God,</hi> that lives, and abides, and endures for ever; which Word is a Word of Order.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Steps of a good Man are ordered by the lord, and he delights in his Way. I have been young and now am old, yet I have not ſeen the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging Bread: He is ever merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and lendeth, and his Seed is bleſſed,</hi> Pſalm 37.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee, how the Lord delights in him, and them that walk in the Steps, the Lord orders them with his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him that orders his Converſation aright, ſhall ſee the Salvation of God,</hi> Pſalm 50.23.</p>
               <p>And this Order muſt be in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in Chriſt the Saviour.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſpoken many things to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Thereſt will I ſet in Order when I come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.34.</p>
               <p>And he ſaith concerning the <hi>Collections for the Saints,</hi> in 1 Cor. 16.1. <hi>As I have given Order to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>even ſo do ye</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>)</p>
               <p>So they were to practiſe the ſame Order, which were the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſt, which the Apſtle in the Power of Chriſt had given to them.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle had the Wiſdom of God, which he had ordained before the World began, unto the Glory of his People then and now alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And the Order that the Apoſtle did give to the Churches of the <hi>Galatians</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was, <hi>That upon the Firſt Day of the Week, every one of them lay by him in ſtore as God had proſpered him,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 16.2.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:96751:229"/>
               <p>And in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. When they had <hi>ordained</hi> Elders in every Church, and had prayed, they commended them to the Lord on whom they had believed, confirming the Souls of the Diſciples,<note place="margin">Elders Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to continue in the <hi>Faith;</hi> and that they muſt through much Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Paul</hi> and others with him went through the Cities,<note place="margin">Decrees to be kept.</note> they delivered them the Decrees for to keep, that were ordaine of the Apoſtles and Elders which were at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo were the Churches eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and increaſed in Number daily, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>And the Occaſion of theſe Decrees was, becauſe ſome Men that went from <hi>Judea,</hi> taught the Brethren, ſaying, <hi>Except ye be circamciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Acts 15. And theſe Decrees were to ſtop ſuch Preachers.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtles and Elders ſaid, <hi>Foraſmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us, have troubled you with ords, ſubverting your Souls, ſaying, Ye muſt be circumciſed, and keep the Law; to whom we gave no ſuch Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is clear, the Apoſtles and Elders gave theſe Teachers no ſuch Commandment, to preach ſuch Doctrine to Trouble the Chruches.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſpent ſome time t <hi>Caeſaria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> he went over all the Country of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia</hi> in Order, ſtrengthening all the Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>So you may ſee, how they were a Comfort one to another.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle writes to <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus <hi>in</hi> Creete.</note> Chap. 1. <hi>For this Cauſe I have left thee in</hi> Creete, <hi>that thou ſhouldſt ſet in Order the thins that are wanting; and ordain Elders in every City, as I have appointed thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here <hi>Titus</hi> in the Sapirit of <hi>God</hi> did obſerve that which <hi>Paul</hi> in the Power of Chriſt did exhort him to.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as are againſt the Order and Pracxtice in the Light and Goſpel, cannot order their Speeches by teaſon of SDarkneſs.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Though I be abſent in the Fleſh, yet am I with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding your Order, and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of your Faith in Chriſt: As ye have therefore received Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle rejoyced in the Order that kept them in the Faith and Steadfaſtneſs in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith,<hi>Every Man in his own Order, Chriſt the Firſt Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in</hi> Adam <hi>all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they that are alive in Chriſt Jeſus, are in his Order of Life and Light, and in his Goſpel the Power of God.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be done Decently and in Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Heavens and the Earth, and all things therein,<note place="margin">All things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Lord.</note> are governed and ordered by the Lord, in his Power and Wiſdom; and all God's Holy Angels are governed and ordered by God; and all God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and People are governed and ordered by God and Chriſt in his Light, and Spirit, and Grace, and Truth, and Power, Goſpel and Word of Life.</p>

               <p>AND now,<note place="margin">1680</note> 
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> you who are called into this glorious Liberty of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 362.</note> ſtand faſt in it. And as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have been called unto Liberty,<note place="margin">Of ture Liberty.</note> only uſe it not for an Occaſion to the Fleſh; but in Love ſerve one another,</hi> Gal. 5.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As free, not uſing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.</p>
               <p>For there were ſome, who while they promiſed themſelves Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they themſelves were Servants of Corruption: Such were like the Dog and the Sow, biting, and renting, and vomiting, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the Mire; and as bad as the Synagogue of the <hi>Libertines</hi> that turned againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 6.9.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle was careful of the Churches Liberty in Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>But take heed, leſt this libet of yours become a Stumbing-block to them that are Weak,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle was ſo careful and tender, that he would no have his true Liberty judged of another man's Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may ſee more at large in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Falſs Brethren came unawares privily, to ſpy out their Liberty, which they had in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring them into Bondage; to whom we gave place by Subjection, no not for an Hour, that the Truth of the Goſpel might continue with you</hi> (to wit, the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>) <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p>And therefore he exhorts them to ſtand faſt in that Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whith Chriſt Jeſus hath made them free,<note place="margin">To ſtand faſt in the Liberty of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the Duty of all <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> now, for to ſtand faſt in that heavenly glorious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which Chriſt the heavenly and ſpiritual Man, the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> makes them free in; and in this they will have Salt int hemſelves, to diſcern between the true Liberty and Freedom and the falſe, and know how to uſe their holy and ſpirtual Liberty and Freedom in Chriſt Jeſus, to the Praiſe and Glory of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, <hi>Friends,</hi> the Lord God Almighty preſerve you all, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Order of Chriſt Jeſus, in his holy <hi>Seed, Life, Pfower</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> that all may live and walk in it, to the Praiſe, and Glory, and Honour of God and Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And tho' Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Thirſt and Cold, many times you are in, and many Diſtreſſes, yet the Lord is able to ſupport you. And now, that you may mind the Lord in your Poverty, and prize his Mercies; and conſider how that did not enough prize his Mercies, and Liberty and Plenty. And ye may read 107th <hi>Pſalm</hi> throughout; there ye may ſee how the Lord brought down ſuch as contemned his <hi>Counſel,</hi> and rebelled againſt his <hi>Words:</hi> Well, what can you tell but that this may be the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> with you, in your Captivity, to bring down your Hearts and Spirits, that with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> you may turn to him, who is a God at Hand; and that you may call upon the Lord in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that all your Sufferings, Afflictions and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity may be ſanctified to you.

And therefore do that which is Juſt, that you may inherit <hi>Chriſt</hi> and your ſpiritual Land. <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtranger, ſeeing you were ſtrangers; nor vex the Widows and Fatherleſs.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>You ſhall be holy Men unto me.</hi> Again, the Lord ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe Report,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Put not thy Hand with the wicked to an unrighteous Witneſs. Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a Cauſe, to decline after many, to wreſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Exod. 23.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">To Reſpect no Man in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not do unrighteouſneſs in judgment; thou ſhalt not reſpect the Perſon of the Poor, nor honour the Perſon of the Mighty: But in righteouſneſs thou ſhalt judge thy neighbour,</hi> Levit. 19.15.

And again he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not reſpect Perſons in judgment; but ye ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great: You ſhall not be afraid of the face of Man; for the judgment as God's:</hi> So long as ye judge Righteouſly.</p>
               <p>And therefore, now <hi>Friends,</hi> my deſire is, That you all may be kept in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Humility, and in that you will have a ſenſe of all things, that whatever you act, it may be done in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, to the Praiſe of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> who is over all, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and ſees all your Words and Actions; that you may behold and ſee with his <hi>Spirit, His</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> Divine Majeſty among you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Chriſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven.</note> the <hi>Lord</hi> from <hi>Heaven;</hi> and is not called the Goſpel of <hi>old Adam</hi> in Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; and this Goſpel, which is the <hi>Power of God unto Saluation,</hi> it keeps all that believes in it, in the Everlaſting Joy, Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and in Order; for it is the Everlaſting Goſpel, which brings <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> to Light, by which they ſee over the <hi>Devil,</hi> and before he was, that hath blinded them, and darkned them from <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality.</hi> So in this Goſpel, that hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> to Light in God's People, both Men and Women, they are eſtabliſhed in the Order of it, in which they do ſerve the Eternal Everlaſting God of Truth.</p>
               <p>Now all they that do not receive the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> which is preached to every, or in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under Heaven, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> is not brought to Light in them; and ſuch the God of the World hath blinded (and ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Blind under the God of the World) and ſuch are Blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Order of the Goſpel, and are ignorant of their Salvation, and of that Joy, and Comfort, and Peace of the Goſpel; neither can they ſerve God in the Goſpel, though they may profeſs Chriſt, and his Goſpel in words, yet ſuch hath no Comfort of it. And therefore ſuch as diſobeys the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> and will not receive it, nor believe in it, How can they receive the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:96751:239"/>Order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, the hevenly Man, from whence the Goſpel comes; or to receive him to reign in their Hearts, when they will not receive his Goſpel, the <hi>Power of God to Salvation,</hi> in their Hearts? And again, How can they receive his People, or believe his People, that are in the Order of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and him in their Hearts, who diſobeys it, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in their own Hearts? Such are not like to come into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel, that diſobey it: Such will diſobey <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and will not regard his People, in whom he reigns, who walk in the Order of his Goſpel, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it's <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, with the <hi>Light</hi> (which is the <hi>Life</hi> in himſelf) and every one that believeth in the <hi>Light,</hi> and becomes Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> and walks in it, they walk in Unity and Fellowſhip, and in the Order of the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> in ſuch <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth reign: And all them that hate this <hi>Light,</hi> and will not come to it, nor believe in it, they are condemned by it.</p>

               <p>And God pouring out if his Spirit upon all Fleſh: All that are <hi>led by the Spirit of God, and Chriſt, are the Sons of God;</hi> and ſuch are obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt's Spiritual Order and Government: And they that quench the Spirit of God, and rebels againſt it, rebels againſt <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Order and Government, and Him in his People; and their Spiritual Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Goſpel of Salvation being preached to every Creature under Heaven; which <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Every Creature under Heaven muſt receive this <hi>Goſpel</hi> in their Hearts, if they receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Government,</hi> and his <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and him to rule in their Hearts.</p>

               <p>And Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples and Followers, That <hi>He would ſend them the Spirit of Truth</hi> (the <hi>Comforter</hi>) <hi>which ſhould proceed from the Father and the Son, which ſhould lead them into all Truth: and be ſhould reprove the World of Sin, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> So that which leads the Believers and Diſeiples of Chriſt into all Truth, and is their Comforter, is the Reprover of the World of their Sin, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Judgment.

               <p>Dear <hi>Friends,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 373.</note> with my Love in the Lord to you all: It hath been often in my mind, from a Senſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord;</hi> which thing I ſhall lay before you, and commend it to the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in all your Conſciences.</p>
               <p>The thing is this,<note place="margin">Advice to have a Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
                  </note> That if you had (once in a Year) a <hi>Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as they have in <hi>Holland, Cermany</hi> and <hi>Freezlan,</hi> and at <hi>Road</hi> Iſland, and in <hi>England,</hi> and elſe where, which is, and hath been, of great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for <hi>Friends</hi> to ſee one another, and know how the Affairs of <hi>Truth</hi> proſpers, and how <hi>Friends</hi> doth grow in the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the Comfort and Joy of one another in it; in which the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is exalted: And if there ſhould be any Difference among <hi>Friends,</hi> it may be ended at the <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> by ſome <hi>Friends</hi> out of the <hi>Meeting,</hi> which could not be ended at other <hi>Meetings:</hi> So that all things (by the Truth, and Power of God) may be kept in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> all dwelling in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that's from above, which is pure, and peaceable, and gentle, and eaſie to be entreated. And ſo for you once in a Year to meet together in the <hi>Lord's Power,</hi> and to wait upon him in his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> one day, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day you may have a Yearly Men and Womens <hi>Meeting</hi> in the Lord's Power; which in time you may find and feel a great Service in the Lord's Spirit and Power; in which you may feel his Preſence and Bleſſing flow among you; and as for <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> I ſhall leave it to your beſt Convenience; and the Lord direct you, that you may do all things, whatever you do, to his Glory; for you know that in other Countries, or Provinces, they have either Half-Year <hi>Meetings,</hi> or Yearly <hi>Meetings,</hi> except it be in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which ſeveral times hath been in my Mind for you to have one there; for where they are ſettled, they ſee a great Service in them; and the Lord hath owned them, and honoured them with his Preſence, and that keeps all in a Senſe of a care of his Glory, and a care of one another, that they may be kept and preſerved in <hi>God's Eternal Truth,</hi> in meekneſs, in gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in tenderneſs, and in love, that edifies the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> And ſo that all of you, in Godlineſs, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, may ſpend your Days to the Glory of God; that your <hi>Converſations</hi> may be in Heaven, and not below in the Earth, among the wicked, that the <hi>Lord God,</hi> and his Son <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> may be glorified in you all, who is over all, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> it would be very well, if that you brought on your your Caſe of <hi>not Swearing,</hi> and taking <hi>Oaths,</hi> which hath been loſt through that Spirit which was unfaithful: Now the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor is come over again, in whoſe time (when he was there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) that <hi>Act</hi> was obtained,<note place="margin">Yea and Nay inſtead of an Oath.</note> at the Aſſembly, in which your <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> was taken inſtead of an <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Swearing.</hi> Therefore
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:96751:240"/>ſee if you can prevail with this Governor, and his Aſſembly, to have the ſame <hi>Act</hi> renewed again, and to clear your ſelves from that <hi>Spirit</hi> which was the cauſe that the <hi>Act</hi> was repealed.

               <p>And my Deſires are, That you may all be preſerved in <hi>God's Power,</hi> to his <hi>Glory;</hi> and that you may grow in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and with the <hi>Truth</hi> anſwer the <hi>Truth</hi> in every one's inward parts; ſo that ye may ſpread the <hi>Truth</hi> abroad, and that with it your Hearts may be united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <hi>whatſoever thing's are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things:</hi> Which are very good things to be minded, thought upon, and practiſed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Lord faith by <hi>Zachary, Theſe are the things that ye ſhall do, ſpeak ye every Man the Truth to his Neighbour, execuſe the Judgment of Truth and Peace in the Gates:</hi> Again, <hi>Therefore faith the Lord, I am returned unto</hi> Zion, <hi>and will dwell in the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be called a City of Truth, and the Mountain of the Lord of Hoſt, an holy Mountain.</hi> And if outward <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called ſo in the Days of the Old Teſtament, ſurely much more is heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the New Covenant and Teſtament, called <hi>The City of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem; into which nothing that is unclean can enter; but all the Believers in the <hi>Light,</hi> and the Children of the <hi>Light,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, whoſe Names are written in the <hi>Lamb's Book</hi> of <hi>Life;</hi> and are to walk in Truth and Righteouſneſs, and <hi>ſpeak the Truth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man to his Neighbour,</hi> according to the Apoſtle's Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And ſo as every one hath received <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who is the Truth, walk in him the Truth, and ſpeak the Truth, as it is in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: For you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your Bodies and in your Spirits, which are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Lord in Mercy grant, that all his People (who profeſs his <hi>Name</hi>) may do ſ to his Praiſe, to his Glory, and to his Honour, over all for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 382.</note> Conſider how the Bleſſing of the Lord came upon the Obedient and faithful to the Lord, and reſted upon them. The Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and from thy Fathers Houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Promiſe to the Faithful.</note> &amp;c. <hi>And I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will bleſs thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing, and I will Bleſs them that Bleſs thee, and Curſe them that Curſe thee; and in thee and thy Seed, ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed. Abraham</hi> obeyed the Lord, and went forth from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> and ſo he left all the Religions and Worſhips, and Teachers of the Country of the <hi>Caldees</hi> behind him, and followed the Lord: And the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. 17.1. And again, The Lord ſaid unto <hi>Abraham, Seeing that Abraham ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty Nation, and all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed in him,</hi> Gen. 12.1, 2, 3. &amp; 18.18. And again, The Lord ſaid unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, That in Bleſſing I will Bleſs thee, and in Multiplying I will Multiply thy Seed as the Stars of Heaven, and as the Sand which is upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar, and thy Seed ſhall poſſeſs the Gates of his Enemies;</hi>

                  <hi>and in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be Bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt Obeyed my Voice. Abraham</hi> Obeying God's Voice, brought this Bleſſing upon him, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I know</hi> Abraham <hi>that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children and his Houſhold after him, That they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>all that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> Now you may ſee here what it is that brings the Bleſſing, and kept the Bleſſing upon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>&amp;c. Now if you be of the true Faith, you are of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and are bleſſed with faithful Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.9. And in this Seed and Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you will Command your Children and your Houſhold after you, to keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring the Bleſſing upon you and your Houſhold and Children; keeping in the ſame Faith and Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and you and your Children and your Houſhold, keeping in the way of the Lord to do Juſtice and Judgment, then I ſay the Bleſſing which came upon <hi>Abraham</hi> will come upon you, and upon your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and your Houſhold, and then you will know the Promiſe of God fulfilled; <hi>Curſed is he that Curſes thee, and Bleſſed is he that Bleſſeth thee;</hi> and therefore live and walk in the Seed, <hi>which bruiſes the Head of the Serpent,</hi> in which Seed all Nations are Bleſſed, yea all Families, Houſholds and Children, in which Faith and Seed you <hi>Command.</hi> (Mark Command) <hi>your Children and your Houſhold after you, to keep the way of the Lord as Abraham did, to do Juſtice and Judgment,</hi> Gen. 18. &amp; 19. Now you that have not this Authority to Command <hi>over</hi> your Children and Houſholds, you are not in the Faith and Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to wit,<note place="margin">To Command our Families to keep the way of the Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>To Command your Children and Houſhold after you, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> Now the Lord had a Confidence in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo he hath in all them that be of his Seed and Faith now, that they will Command their Children and Houſhold to keep the way of the Lord, as he did, and walk before the Lord, and to do Juſtice and Judgment; and that

                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family and Children ſhould not go back again into thoſe Country Religions or Ways, which the Seed and Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> hath and had led them out of: For they that are commanded to come out of them, into God's Way, into the Way of the Lord, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keep in the Way of the Lord, and they are to command their Children and their Houſhold to keep the Way of the Lord, and to keep out of all the Ways of the World, and out of all the Ungodly, Unjuſt Ways, in the Seed, which bruiſes the Head of the Serpent. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>I will make thy Seed to multiply as the Stars of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 26.4. Now here you may ſee that <hi>Iſaac</hi> inherited his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inheritance in the Seed, and in the Faith and Way of the Lord; in which Seed all Nations are bleſt: And ſo do all they that are of the Faith and Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that walk in the ſteps of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Way of the Lord, and obey his Voice,<note place="margin">They who obey <hi>God</hi>'s Voice inherit the Bleſſing.</note> inherit the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for you may ſee it was not the only Care, that their Children might inherit a little Earth after them, but that they might inherit the Seed and the Faith, which had the Bleſſing</p>

                  <hi>And</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſaid to</hi> Jacob, <hi>God Almighty bleſs thee, and give the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>to thee, and to thy Seed with thee,</hi> Gen. 28. And this <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſpake to <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Jacob</hi> had any Children; and here you may ſee <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s care, that <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Seed might inherit the Faith and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and this ſhould be their firſt Inheritance, and then they ſhould inherit the outward Land: And this ſhould be the care of all them that walk in the ſteps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſee, that their Children and Houſhold do inherit the Faith, Seed and Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the firſt place, by keeping <hi>in the Way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And they are to command their Children to walk <hi>in the Way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. that they may ſo do; and you may ſee, that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did inherit the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Seed and Faith.</p>
               <p>When the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Jacob, Thy Seed ſhall be as the Duſt of the Earth, and thou ſhall ſpread abroad to the</hi> Weſt, <hi>and to the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>and to the</hi> North, <hi>and to the</hi> South, <hi>and in thee, and in thy Seed ſhall all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> So here you may ſee <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſſeſſion, who did inherit the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and they that are of the Seed and Faith, which keep the <hi>Way of the Lord,</hi> they do inherit this Bleſſing in the Seed, in which all Nations are bleſt: And this is according to <hi>Chriſt</hi> Doctrine,<note place="margin">Seek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>God</hi> firſt.</note>

                  <hi>The good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.38. And this is the <hi>Seed</hi> in which all Nations are bleſt, who keep the Way of the Lord, and Juſtice and Judgment, ſuch the Almighty hath bleſſed with <hi>the Bleſſings from above,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Bleſſing of the Faithful.</note> 
                  <hi>the Bleſſings of the deep, the Bleſſing of the breaſt, and of the womb,</hi> Gen. 49. <hi>And he will alſo bleſs the fruit of the Land, thy Corn, and thy Wine, and thy Oil, and the increaſe of thy Kine, and the flocks of thy Sheep,</hi> Deut. 7. <hi>And they that ſerve the Lord their God, he will bleſs their Bread and their Water,</hi> Exod. 23. <hi>And a faithful Man ſhall abound with Bleſſings,</hi> Prov. 28.20. So you may ſee, they that are in the Faith, and in the Holy Seed, which keeps in the Way of the Lord, and commands their Children and Houſhold to do the ſame; they have the Bleſſings from Heaven above, and the Bleſſings below, yea, the Bleſſings of the Eternal Inheritance, and of the Kingdom of God; and that was their <hi>chief Inheritance,</hi> That all the Faithful Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſought to poſſeſs their Houſhold and their Children in, who did command their Children and Houſhold to keep the Way of God, that they might inherit the Bleſſing. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that walketh not in the counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of Sinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the Scornful: But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth meditate Day and Night.</hi> Now here is the condition of them that do enjoy the Bleſſing, they muſt keep from the Counſel of the Ungodly, and the Way of Sinners, and the Seat of the Scornful: Now here you may ſee <hi>David</hi>'s Inſtruction, how People might inherit the Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Levit. 10. <hi>That you may put a difference betwixt the holy and unholy, and between the clean and unclean, and that you may teach your Children all the Statutes, which the Lord hath ſpoken unto them by the hand of</hi> Moſes. And it was ſo in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that they might learn the Statutes there: Surely much more they are to learn the Commands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9, 10.<note place="margin">To Teach our Children the Fear of the Lord.</note> They were to <hi>Teach their Sons, and their Sons Sons;</hi> and again, they were to <hi>Teach their Children, that they might learn to fear God all the days that they lived upon the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. This they were to teach their <hi>Children;</hi> and again, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. It was the Command of God, that they were to Teach their <hi>Children</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and they were to ſpeak of them, when they ſat in their Houſe, and when they walk'd by the Way, when they lay down, and when they roſe up; and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Moſes</hi> told them, that <hi>The Word was nigh them, in their Mouths, and in their Hearts, that they might do it.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Come you Children, hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord. O fear the Lord you Saints; there is no want to them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 34.9, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye that fear the Lord, truſt in the Lord, he is their Help and their Shield,</hi> Pſal. 115.11. And you may ſee all along in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> they that feared the Lord were commanded to teach and inſtruct their Children the Way of the Lord, that they might walk in it, and inherit the Bleſſing; which was a better Portion than outward Riches which will paſs away; for <hi>they make themſelves Wings and fly away. Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Train up a Child in the may he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it: Fooliſhneſs is bound up in the Heart of a Child, but the Rod of Correction ſhall drive it far from him,</hi> Prov. 22.15.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:96751:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>He that ſpareth the Rod, hateth his Son; but he that loveth him, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth him betimes. By Mercy and Truth, iniquity is purged out; and by the Fear of the Lord, they depart from evil,</hi> Prov. 13.24. and 16.6. And the Apoſtle's Command is, For <hi>Children to obey their Parents in the Lord, for this is right,</hi> Eph. 6.1. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3, 20.</p>
               <p>It is well pleaſing to the Lord, <hi>Children to obey their Parents;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Children to obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> were to <hi>Rule well their own Houſes, and to have their Children in ſubjection, with all gravity;</hi> and likewiſe, the <hi>Deacons were to rule their own Children and their own Houſes well,</hi> Tim. 1.3.

And <hi>That the Word of God be not blaſphemed.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> was to exhort young Men to be Sober-minded: <hi>For the Grace of God which brings Salvation hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all Men, teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent World; that being juſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs according to the Hope of Eternal Life.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>As Obedient Children, not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioning your ſelves according to your former Luſts, in your Ignorance; but as he who hath called you is Holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Be Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo be you Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and be not like them, feeding themſelves without fear, which are the Clouds without Rain, and Wells without Water, and Trees without Fruit,</hi> whom <hi>Jude</hi> declares againſt, <hi>ſuch cannot eat and drink to the Praiſe and Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. So you ſee what care, both in the Old and New Teſtament, the faithful Parents had to teach their Children the Way of the Lord; and the Lord hath a Confidence in all them that fear him, and are of the Faith and Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they will not only admoniſh their Children and Houſhold, but <hi>Command their Children and Houſhold after them, to keep the Way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.

And ſo the Children of God are counted for the Seed, which the good Seed <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, are <hi>the Children of the Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſpake to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>Walk in the ſteps of the Faith of</hi> Abraham. Again, the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> concerning <hi>Titus, Walked we not in the ſame Spirit, walked we not in the ſame ſteps?</hi> And in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi>

               <p>Now <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> Let there be no Strife in all your <hi>Meetings,</hi> nor vain Janglings nor Diſputings; but let all that tends to Strife be ended out of your <hi>Meetings,</hi> that they may be kept Peaceable; ſo that you may be at <hi>Peace</hi> among your ſelves, and the God of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> may fill all your Hearts, which <hi>Love</hi> edifies his Church.<note place="margin">To condeſcend one to another in the Fear of the Lord.</note> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend one to another in the Fear of the Lord, to that which is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, Juſt, Vertuous, and of good Report: And where any Weakneſs has been in any thing, let it be covered and buried in the Spirit and Love of God, that his Spirit and Love may be uppermoſt in you all, to unite all your Hearts together: And that you may all ſhew forth that you are the Children, which the heavenly Wiſdom is juſtified of, which is <hi>Pure,</hi> (mark) <hi>Pure, Peaceable, Gentle,</hi> and eaſie to be intreated, which is above the Wiſdom that is below, that's neither Pure, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor eaſie to be intreated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in all matters of Buſineſs, or Difference, or Controverſies, treat one another in ſuch things kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently, and be not fierce, or heady and high minded; for that Spirit will bring Men and Women to be Lovers of themſelves, and to be Deſpiſers of others, and that which is good, which leads Nature out of its Courſe, and ſo looſes Natural Affections, and at laſt comes to be without Natural Affections; which Spirit we ſee moſt of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is led by: For, if they were in natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections they would not deſtroy their fellow Creatures about <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> but being without natural Affections, they have not Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to their fellow Creatures; to wit, <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> which were made in God's <hi>Image.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> Commanded to <hi>Love their Neighbour as themſelves;</hi>

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:96751:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>Virtue, Sobriety and Modeſty, both to <hi>Turks, Moors, Jews,</hi> and to your <hi>Patroons,</hi> and to the <hi>Families</hi> where you live; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath enlightned every Man that comes into the World,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath enlightened all Men.</note> he hath enlightned the <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> with the Light (which is the Life in him the Word) that all in the Light might know God and Chriſt; and <hi>The Grace of God which brings Salvation hath appeared unto all Men;</hi> ſo to the <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> yea, to all Nations; ſo that with the Grace of God they may be taught to deny Ungodlineſs and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and live Righteouſly and Godly; and therefore all muſt come to this <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their Hearts, which brings their Salvation (if they have Salvation) and come to the Throne of Grace; and this is the Covenant of Grace, in which is the Election; and God (who made all) pours out of his Spirit upon all Men and Women in the World, in the Days of his <hi>New Covenant,</hi> yea, upon <hi>Whites</hi> and <hi>Blacks, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Indians, Chriſtians, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that all with the Spirit of God, might know <hi>God</hi> and the things of <hi>God,</hi> and ſerve and worſhip him in his Spirit and Truth, that he hath given them; but they that do reſiſt the Truth, and quench, and vex, and grieve and rebel againſt the Spirit that <hi>God</hi> hath given them, ſuch are not like to ſerve and worſhip God in his Spirit and Truth; but he that endures to the end in <hi>God's Grace, Spirit, Light</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> is preached to every Creature under Heaven; which <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the Power of God, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace;</hi> and ſo it is <hi>glad Tidings</hi> to every Creature under Heaven, and to all Nations, to the <hi>Turks, Jews, Indians, Moors, Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> if they receive and obey the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> it is <hi>glad Tidings</hi> to them all. Now, this is the Day of <hi>God</hi>'s gathering: And therefore all muſt come to the <hi>Light, Grace, Truth, Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in their own Particulars, which they have from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that by it they might be built upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their heavenly Rock and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who is their Way to God, who bruiſes the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s Head, and through Death deſtroyed Death, and the <hi>Devil</hi> the Power of Death, and ſo deſtroys Death, and ſo deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works; for <hi>Sin</hi> brought Death; and now <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who deſtroys Death that Sin brought, and makes an end of Sin, is the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for all his Believers in all Storms and Tempeſts, Trials, and Troubles and Sufferings to reſt upon, in whom they have Peace; yea, Life and Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now there is a common Saying among the <hi>Turks</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtians [Your Crucified God]</hi> meaning <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Now this is their miſtake, tho' God was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> reconciling the World to himſelf, it was not the <hi>Eternal God</hi> that died,<note place="margin">It was Chriſt, as he was Man, who ſuffered in the Fleſh, upon the Croſs, and not God that was crucified.</note> and was crucified, that was in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, when he was about to ſuffer, <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> So <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered in the Fleſh, and died, and was crucified, as he was Man, not as he was God, the Word, which was in the Beginning; but as he was Man, who bore the Sins and Iniquities of all Mankind, and was an <hi>Offering</hi> for the Sins of the whole World, who through Death taſted Death for every Man; all being in Death in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that they might have <hi>Life</hi> through <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> So, I ſay again, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not die as he was God, but as Man: <hi>He was crucified and buried, and roſe again the third Day, and aſcended, and is at the Right Hand of God;</hi> this he did by the <hi>Power</hi> of

                  <hi>God,</hi> as he was Man. So the <hi>Turks</hi> are miſtaken, to ſay, or to think, that the <hi>Eternal God</hi> could be crucified or dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I thought needful to write a Letter to you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this their <hi>miſtake,</hi> which you may be wiſe in making uſe of;<note place="margin">To exalt God's Name in their Captivity.</note> and my deſires are, that you may be preſerved, and exalt <hi>God's Name</hi> in your Places of Captivity, and in your Lives, Words and Converſations, anſwering God's Witneſs in the <hi>Turks, Jews, Moors,</hi> and your <hi>Patroons.</hi> And keep low, and walk wiſely, that you may be a good <hi>Savour</hi> in the Hearts of all there-aways; and then the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the Lord, and his Preſence, will reſt upon you, and be in you: I think you have more Liberty to meet there than we have here; for they keep us out of our <hi>Meetings,</hi> and caſt us into <hi>Priſon,</hi> and ſpoil our <hi>Goods.</hi> And therefore prize your Liberty in your <hi>Meetings,</hi> and do not abuſe it; and the Lord preſerve you all in his <hi>Grace, Fear</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that you may grow up in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head, and walk in him, to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Read this openly in your <hi>Meetings;</hi> and I have ſent you here ſome Books that you may read them, and give them to the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> as you may ſee fit; which Books are to the <hi>Turks,</hi> one concerning <hi>Good Converſation;</hi> and another concerning the <hi>Temple;</hi> and another concerning <hi>Abraham inſtructing his Family,</hi> and one to all Kings and Princes; and another concerning <hi>Revelation and Inſpiration,</hi> with ſome others, to read among your ſelves.</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I wrote unto you an Epiſtle, not to keep company with Fornicators; yet not altogether with the Fornicators of this World, nor with the Covetous, Extortioners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not to keep Company with Scandalous Perſons.</note> 
                  <hi>Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For then ye muſt needs go out of the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. <hi>But now I have written unto you, Not to keep Company; if any Man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with ſuch an one, no not to eat.</hi> Therefore you ſee all ſuch are to be avoided, as knowing, <hi>neither Fornicators, Adulterers, Effeminate, and Abuſers of themſelves with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> So ye may ſee, all ſuch Workers you are not to keep Company with, nor ſo much as to eat with them, though they have gone under the Notion of Brothers and Siſters. So the <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt be kept clean of ſuch; for the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:96751:252"/>Feaſt muſt be kept with <hi>unleavened Bread</hi> of Sincerity and Truth. So the old <hi>Leaven</hi> muſt be purged out; <hi>For a little Leaven leavens the whole Lump.</hi> And therefore ye muſt be a new Lump, as ye are lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by it; <hi>For even Chriſt our Paſsover is ſacrificed for us.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as is ſaid before) let us keep the Feaſt with Sincerity and Truth.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally yoked.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye not unequally yoked together with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers: For what Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs? And what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? And what Concord hath Chriſt with Belial? And what part hath he that Believeth with an Infidel?</hi> (Mark, <hi>Part</hi>) <hi>and what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you</hi> (that is, take care for you) <hi>and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore if God's Sons and Daughters muſt be ſeparated from all ſuch things without, and not to touch them, neither to have an agreement or unity with them, nor be yoked with ſuch Actions and Actors without, and not touch ſuch as act ſuch things: Then, are they not to be ſeparated from all ſuch Actions and Actors within, and not to touch ſuch as act ſuch things, though he be called a Brother or Siſter, ſeeing ſuch Actions makes them <hi>Infidels,</hi> and like <hi>Belial,</hi> and bring them into <hi>Darkneſs?</hi> And if there be no Fellowſhip, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Yoaking or Agreement with ſuch Actions and Actors without, then what Yoaking, Communion, or Fellowſhip and Agreement (mark Agreement) can there be with ſuch as act ſuch things within, that is called a Brother or Siſter, or keep Company with ſuch, or Eat with ſuch, <hi>that have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore ſuch Leapers that defile the <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ought to be turned out of it, till they be healed and cleanſed from ſuch <hi>Leproſies;</hi> as knowing that ſuch Actions and Actors are out of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and out of the <hi>Holy City, New</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem:</hi> And no unclean thing comes into the Kingdom of God, nor enters into the Kingdom, the Holy City: And none comes into the Holy City, but by Repentance, and being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and changed from all manner of Evil and Uncleanneſs whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Adulterer is brought to a Morſel of Bread, and the Sloathful goes in Raggs: But the Vertuous are Happy, and the Diligent are Rich that ſerve the Lord.<note place="margin">To have no Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Works of Darkneſs.</note> Therefore have no <hi>Fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Works of Darkneſs,</hi> but rather reprove them: For the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fellowſhip (that are the Believers) is in the <hi>Light,</hi> which is the <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And ſo their Fellowſhip is with the Father and the Son, and their Communion is in the Holy Ghoſt, which proceeds from the Father and the Son. And therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to abſtain from every Appearance of Evil: And if they are to abſtain from every Appearance of Evil, then they cannot joyn or have unity with them, where Evil appears.</p>
               <p>And again, the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> That <hi>they were to ſtudy to be quiet, and to do their own buſineſs, and to work with their own hands, and to walk honeſtly towards them that are without; and that ye may have lack of nothing.</hi> So here you may ſee the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:96751:252"/>in the <hi>Truth</hi> that the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Church</hi> to Practice. Firſt, <hi>They are all to ſtudy to be quiet.</hi> Secondly, <hi>They are all to do their own buſineſs, and work with their own hands, that they may lack no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">None to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Bodies.</note> And Thirdly, <hi>To walk honeſtly towards them that are without:</hi> And if they walk honeſtly towards them that are without, they muſt walk honeſtly to them that are within. For the Apoſtle had ſome occaſion to write to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> upon the Matter: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly, working not at all, but are buſie Bodies: Now them that are ſuch we command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work, and eat their own Bread: And if any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed. Yet count him not as an Enemy, but admoniſh him as a Brother.</hi> You may ſee there were not thoſe groſs Evils charged upon him, as were upon ſome among the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> So you may ſee the Apoſtle's care in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to keep all things clean and pure, and all diligent in their places, ſerving the Lord, and not to be buſie Bodies, and talkers about other Men's buſineſs; but to be quiet, and not idle, but <hi>doing their own buſineſs, that they may lack nothing;</hi> and ſo eat their own <hi>Bread</hi> Natural and Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Widows in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 5. what ſort of Widows they were to receive:<note place="margin">To inſtruct the Elder as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the younger Men as Brethren.</note> And ye may ſee firſt the <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>lovely Practice</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt; Rebuke not an Elder, but intreat him as a Father, and younger Men as Brethren; and the elder Women as Mothers, and the younger Women as Siſters, with all purity:</hi> So are theſe to be intreated; <hi>And honour Widows, that are Widows indeed. And if any Widow have Children or Nephews, let them learn</hi> (mark, <hi>learn</hi>) <hi>firſt to ſhew piety at home, and requite their Parents; for that is good and acceptable before God.</hi> So this Piety muſt be learn'd and ſhewed at home; and theſe the Widows muſt learn to look to. Here theſe Widow-women have a ſervice; and in the firſt place they muſt <hi>learn to ſhew Piety at home, and to their Parents and Nephews, and to ſhew it abroad then in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> So all muſt learn this Leſſon, to ſhew <hi>Piety</hi> to their Children and Nephews, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their Parents. For this Practice and Service is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God.</p>
               <p>Now the State of <hi>deſolate Widows, She that is a Widow indeed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Widow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</note> 
                  <hi>and deſolate, truſteth in God, and continueth in Supplications and Prayers night and day: But ſhe that lives in Pleaſure is dead while ſhe lives. Theſe things give in charge, that they may be blameleſs: But if any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he has denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel</hi> (mark, that is worſe than the <hi>World</hi>) For the <hi>Faith</hi> brings every Man and every Widow to be diligent, and to provide for their own; that is, their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Nephews,</hi> or <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> as before: But the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Eſpecially thoſe of his own Houſe:</hi> And ſo here is <hi>Piety</hi> to be ſhewn ſtill two ways; <hi>For his own, and eſpecially to thoſe of his own Houſe</hi> or <hi>Family;</hi> and here are <hi>Nephews</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Again the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let not a Widow be taken into the Number under Threeſcore Years Old,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, here was a Number that the Widow was to be taken into; and the Widow that was to be taken
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:96751:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>into this Number, ſee her qualifications before ſhe come into the Number. She muſt be well reported of for good <hi>Works,</hi> if ſhe have brought up <hi>Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow indeed.</note> if ſhe have lodged <hi>Strangers,</hi> if ſhe have waſhed the <hi>Saints Feet,</hi> if ſhe have relieved the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> if ſhe have dilgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed every good <hi>Work, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the qualified Widows that are to be taken into the Number: So here was a great Practice, and a diligence in Piety for this Woman to do, before ſhe was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Number of the Faithful. But ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> The Younger Refuſe; for when they begin to wax Wanton againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. they caſt off their firſt Faith, and withal, they learn to be Idle; ſo they forſake to learn and ſhew Piety, and to live in that; and ſo do not learn to be diligent; and wander about from Houſe to Houſe, and not only Idle, but <hi>Tattlers</hi> and <hi>buſie-Bodies,</hi> ſpeaking things they ought not; and therefore ſuch things were, and are to be reproved: ſuch as theſe were not to be received, and taken into the Number of the Faithful but to be refuſed.</p>
               <p>And again the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will therefore, that ye Younger Woman Marry, bear Children, guide the Houſe, give no occaſion to the Adverſary to ſpeak reproachfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">To relieve our own Relations, and to charge the Church with them.</note> 
                  <hi>If any Man or Woman that believeth, have Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, let them relieve them, and let not the Church be charged; that it may relieve thoſe that are Widows indeed.</hi> So here you may ſee the Care, Piety and Duty, if either Man or Woman that Believes, have Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, they are to relieve them, and not let the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> be charged with them. So let Men and Women learn to ſhew Piety to <hi>Widows,</hi> to <hi>Nephews,</hi> and to <hi>Parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timothy, I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one before another, do nothing by partiality, lay hands ſuddenly on no Man.</hi> So here you may ſee the Apoſtle's Care in the Church of Chriſt, who would have all to be exerciſed in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and be diligent in their Service, that Truth requireth of them.</p>
               <p>And then again, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch as are <hi>Lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Covetous, Proud, Boaſters, diſobedient to Parents, Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Unholy, without natural Affections (to wit, to Husband or Wife, Children, Parents, or others) and likewiſe, Truce-breakers, which break their Covenant or Promiſes in their Marriages, with God and with Man; and ſo likewiſe, break their Truce and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Men in Outward Things; and alſo, ſuch as are falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, Incontinent, Fierce, Deſpiſers of them that are Good, ſuch are not like to be ſubject to the good Spirit of God in themſelves; and Traitors, Heady, High-minded, Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God, having the form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; from ſuch turn away, ſays the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> now if they were to turn away from them, they were not to be heeded, though they had the Form of Godlineſs, and of Chriſtianity; if they were to turn away from them, they were not to receive them into the Camp; for ſuch are as Lepers are to be turned away from. And therefore the Camp of God muſt be kept clean. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given Authority to his Church to admoniſh and exhort, and to reprove and rebuke all ſuch things with his Authority.</p>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:96751:253"/>
               <p>Now, <hi>Friends,</hi> concerning putting on of <hi>Apparrel:</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a Care in the Church of God, that they ſhould adorn themſelves as becomes the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Goſpel A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning.</note> with chaſte Lives and Converſations, and with the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit; which is in the ſight of God of a great Price. This is that which arrays and beautifies God's Church; and not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorning and plaiting the Hair, and every new Faſhion that comes up into the World, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And alſo the Apoſtle writes to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and gives him that Exhortation to the Church, <hi>That Women adorn themſelves with modeſt Apparrel</hi> (mark, <hi>Modeſt</hi>) <hi>with ſhamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſobriety,</hi> (mark, <hi>Sobriety</hi>) <hi>not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls.</hi> For that was the Practice of the <hi>Jew</hi> outward, and is to this Day; <hi>(or coſtly Array.)</hi> But with that which becomes Women pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Godlineſs, <hi>with good Works.</hi> So this is the Adorning that all that profeſs Godlineſs muſt be arrayed withal, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. So that all may be in that good Behaviour, as becomes Godlineſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And likewiſe Chaſte and Diſcreet, Teachers of good things; that the Word of God may not be blaſphemed, which they profeſs; as in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And it's deſired, That all <hi>Friends,</hi> that have <hi>Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To train up Children and Servants in the pure Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> may train them up in the pure and unſpotted Religion, and in the nurture and fear of God; and that frequently they read the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which is much better than to be gadding abroad. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and admoniſh them; that every Family apart may ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord, as well as in Publick. And that when they go to <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> they may take their Servants and Families with them, that they may not go wandring up and down in the Fields, or to Ale-Houſes, as many have done, to the diſhonour of God, and to the diſhonour of their Maſters and Miſtreſſes Families, and to their own Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And therefore, for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake and his pure Religion, let there be Care taken, to prevent all theſe things.

                  <note place="margin">Concerning Marriages.</note> of which very many things have been written, it's deſired that all may be careful in that thing, of running haſtily together: And conſider it firſt; that firſt, as it is God's Joining, ſo it is his Ordinance, and it is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled. And again, ſuch Men as draw out young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Affections, and run from one to another; and leave them, and run to others. And ſuch Women as draw out Mens Affections, and then leave them, and draw out other Mens Affections: Theſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes bring many young Women, and many young Men into Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and are ſharply to be reproved. For this Work is not of God's Joining, but out of his Covenant: Some of which have gone ſo far, as to Promiſes, Eſpouſals and Contracts, and then left them, and gone to others. This is to be Judged and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For, as we make no Contract for Marriages, we break none.</p>

               <p>For I remember, before we were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as I was ſitting in an Houſe in <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> (about the Year 1648) the Word of the Lord came to me and ſaid, <hi>Some of thoſe that ſhould come to be convinced with the Light and Spirit of God, and ſhould come ſo far as</hi> Cain <hi>to hear God's Voice, and as far as</hi> Balaam <hi>to hear God's Voice, and to have ſome Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to come ſo far as</hi> Corah, Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>theſe ſhould be the</hi> Deceivers, <hi>and the</hi> Troublers <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and ſeek to deſtroy the Faithful, and to betray them: Who formerly had ſome Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to talk of, but did not live in the Truth.</hi> Which I and many others have ſeen come to paſs and fulfilled.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Falſe Prophets and Anti-Chriſts.</note> 
                  <hi>That the</hi> falſe Prophets <hi>and the</hi> Anti-Chriſts (which were inwardly the ravened <hi>Wolves,</hi> which the Apoſtles and Believers ſhould beware of) <hi>ſhould come to them, to try them, they had the</hi> Sheeps-cloathing, <hi>and Outward Profeſſion of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>but were Inwardly ravening</hi> Wolves <hi>to devour them.</hi> Now, theſe were Inwardly ravening from ſomething. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch as went out from us: It ſeems, they were one among them, <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out from the true Church, that they might be manifeſt that they were not of it.</hi> And theſe were the Anti-chriſts and falſe Prophets, that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ſhould come,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſaw <hi>were come,</hi> and exhorted the Church to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, and to keep to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> which they had from the <hi>Holy One.</hi> And this <hi>

               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There was to be a falling away firſt, before the Man of Sin was revealed; the Son of Perdition, who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. And when the Apoſtle ſaw the Myſtery of Iniquity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96751:255"/>working; and his coming is after the working of Satan, with all Deceiveableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they receive not the Love of the <hi>Truth,</hi> that they might be ſaved. And ſuch go into ſtrong Deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lye, and not the Truth. And here you may ſee there is a falling away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> be revealed; and they that fall away, receive not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, but believe Lyes that they ſhall be damned. And the Lord will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume him with the Spirit of his Mouth, and will deſtroy him with the Brightneſs of his coming, the wicked One, and Son of Perdition, that is againſt the Righteous, and is the Oppoſer and Betrayer of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore all the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are to ſtand ſtedfaſt,<note place="margin">To ſtand ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in Chriſt.</note> and be eſtabliſh'd in Him, in every good Word and Work, who are from the beginning choſen for Salvation through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> through the Sanctification of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the belief of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and are called by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the Power of God, to the obtaining of the Glory of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom the glorious Reſt and Peace is.</p>

Truly, <hi>Friends,</hi> we have had many of theſe proffers made to Us within this <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty Years,</hi> but we
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:96751:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>never durſt make ſuch Bargains or Covenants, to forſake the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves together, as we uſed to do; but did leave our ſuffering Cauſe wholly to the Lord <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To Commit our Cauſe to God.</note> in whoſe <hi>Name</hi> we were gathered, who has all Power in Heaven and Earth given unto him: And the Lord at laſt did and hath tendered the Hearts of many of our Proſecutors both in <hi>England</hi> and other Places; and therefore in the Spirit and Power of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is good to be faithful; who is God all ſufficient to ſupport and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you all in whatever you do, and ſtrengthen you in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               </p>
               <p>And whereas ſome of the Magiſtrates have alledg'd, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> departed out of the Coaſts of the <hi>Gadarenes</hi> upon their Requeſt, after he had caſt the Devils out of the poſſeſt Men, and they enter'd into their Swine, and run into the Sea. This Argument is of no weight, for you to go out of their Coaſts or City, who are ſettled Citizens, and have Wives and Families; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> went up and down from Place to Place and preached; as he ſaid, <hi>The Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head, though the ſubtle Foxes had Holes, and the high-flown Fowls had their Neſts.</hi> And would they take it kindly themſelves, if the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> their Protector, who is of a contrary Profeſſion, ſhould uſe the ſame Argument to them, and ſay, Be gone, or elſe do not meet at your great Publick Places of Worſhip, but meet in ſmall Companies, or elſe to depart out of theſe Coaſts, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did out of the Coaſts of the <hi>Gadarenes.</hi> And, if ye do not, then you are diſobedient to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Example; as they do apply it upon you. And ſo, let them weigh the Matter and their Argument with the juſt Law of God to do unto you, as they would be done unto themſelves.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I deſire, however, that you walk wiſely,<note place="margin">To walk wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before all.</note> and gently, and lovingly, and meekly, and ſoberly to all the Magiſtrates, and all People, that they may have no juſt Occaſion in any thing againſt you: For the Good muſt overcome the Bad, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Overcome Evil with Good, and dwell in that Love that can bear all things, and endure all things:</hi> And nothing can ſeparate you from this Love which you have in God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> In this Love build up and edifie one another, that by it you may anſwer the Good in all People, and ſpread his Truth abroad, and be valiant for that upon Earth.

                  </note> Haughtineſs, High-mindedneſs, and the abominable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Faſhions, and the ungodly Luſts of the World, which is not of the Father, but of the World. And how Man and Woman came into theſe things by forſaking the Lord, and ſo falling from his Image. And how <hi>Chriſt</hi> renews them up into the Image of God again, to ſerve him in Humility. And all that are in the Image of God are of one Mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>To all Friends and Brethren every where.</head>
               <p>Peace from God and the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be multiplied in you, who by his Grace, Light and Spirit, are turned towards the Lord, to receive it from him; and that by it you may grow up in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> out of the Worlds Nature and Spirit.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid unto his Believers and followers, <hi>Ye are not of the World, even as I am not of the World. I have given them thy Word, and the World hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>love not the World, nor the things of the World, for the love of the World is Enmity to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the beginning God created Man in his own Image: So in the likeneſs of God created he him; Male and Female created he them, and God bleſſed them. And in this ſtate God ſet them, above all things that he had made. But, after Man and Woman had tranſgreſſed the Command of God, they ſewed Figg-leaves together to make them Aprons; for their Eyes were opened, and they came to ſee their Shame. By their Tranſgreſſion, and by tranſgreſſing the Command of God, the ſpiritual Eye came to be ſhut, and Man and Woman came to fall from the Image of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo, after Man and Woman had tranſgreſſed the Command of God, and fallen from his Image, the Lord God made Coats of Skins to cloath them withal. So, you may ſee, That the firſt Covering which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> made after Tranſgreſſion, was made of Figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves; and the natural Sun would ſoon ſcorch and dry them to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: But thoſe that the Lord made them, was of Skins.</p>
               <p>So the tranſgreſſion of the Command of God came, when the Ear went out after the Serpent,<note place="margin">Sin the cauſe of Shame, and Shame the cauſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</note> and the Eye went after the Fruit of the Tree, which God forbid them to Eat of. So here they came to ſee their outward Shame and Nakedneſs; who had fallen from the Image of God that covered them; and therefore they went to cover the outward Shame.</p>
               <p>And now Man and Woman in the Fall, is taking thought what they ſhall eat and drink, and what they ſhall put on: And this is come upon them by forſaking the Lord's Teaching, and following the Serpents.</p>
               <p>And doth not <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World. If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And farther ſaith, <hi>For all that is in the World, the Luſt of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:96751:260"/>the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life; this is not of the Father, but of the World; and the World paſſeth away, and the Luſt thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, all may ſee, what Man and Woman is fallen into, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the Command of God; and therefore it is not good for any to live in that which will paſs away, and is <hi>not of the Father, but of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you may ſee how Pride is cried againſt throughout the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> And they that fear the Lord, do hate Evil,<note place="margin">The evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of Pride.</note> Pride and Arrogancy: <hi>By Pride cometh Contention, and a Man's Pride ſhall bring him low; but Honour upholds the Humble in Spirit,</hi> Prov. 29.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For when Pride cometh, then cometh Shame; and Pride goeth before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and an haughty Mind before a fall; but with the lowly is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Prov. 11.2. and 16.18. <hi>And better it is to be of an humble Spirit with the lowly, than to divide the Spoil with the proud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord of Hoſt hath purpoſed to ſtain the Pride of all Glory, and to bring into contempt all the Honourable of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 23.9. And therefore love not that which God will ſtain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord ſaith, He will ſpread forth his Hands in the midſt of them, as he that ſwimmeth, and he will bring down their Pride,</hi> Iſa. 25.11. And therefore it is good to keep it down in every one. And the Lord cries, <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride, whoſe glorious Beauty is a fading Flower; and when the Crown of Pride is trodden under Foot, the Lord of Hoſt ſhall be for a Crown of Glory,</hi> Iſa. 28.1, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord ſaith, He will marr the Pride of</hi> Judah, <hi>and the great Pride of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.9.</p>
               <p>And doth not <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſay, <hi>Becauſe of the Pride of</hi> Moab, <hi>he was ſo exceeding Proud, his Loftineſs, his Arrogancy, and the Haughtineſs of his Heart brought him unto Deriſion,</hi> Jer. 48.26, 29.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is good to keep in the Humility: For Pride is that which deceives the Heart, and brings the <hi>Judgments of God,</hi> Jer. 49.16. And therefore take heed, <hi>let not Pride budd, leſt the Rod bloſom,</hi> Ezekiel 7. to verſe 11.</p>
               <p>And the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were grown in Pride and fulneſs of Bread, like <hi>Sodom,</hi> when they tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord, like their Father <hi>Adam.</hi> And therefore let them that profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> take heed, leſt they be found in the ſame ſteps.</p>
               <p>And ſee in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16.49. what became of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> confeſſed the Kingdom of God, and Praiſed, and Extolled, and Honoured the King of Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>All his Works are Truth, and his Ways Judgments; and thoſe that walk in Pride. God is able to abaſe,</hi> Dan. 4.34, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Pride of Iſrael doth teſtifie to his Face; and therefore</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Ephraim <hi>ſhall fall in their Iniquity: And</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall fall with them,</hi> Hoſ. 5.5.</p>
               <p>And therefore you may ſee, and take heed of Pride, for it is the cauſe of Man and Womans fall.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7. you may ſee that <hi>Pride</hi> hath hindred Man from ſeeking after the Lord, and turning to him. And you may ſee <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s Deſtruction was for his Pride, <hi>Obad.</hi> 1.</p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:96751:261"/>
               <p>And you may ſee the <hi>Judgments</hi> that came upon the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Aſhur</hi> for their Pride, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Zachariah</hi> 10 and 11 Chapters,<note place="margin">Judgments of God becauſe of Pride.</note> doth not Lord ſay, <hi>The Pride of</hi> Jordan <hi>ſhall be ſpoiled, and the Pride of</hi> Aſyria <hi>ſhall be brought down; and there ſhall be a Voice of Howling of the Shepherds, for their Glory is ſpoiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith in <hi>Mark, Pride is one of thoſe Evils that cometh out of the Heart, and defiles the Man;</hi> ſo take heed of that which defiles.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life; this is not of the Father, but of the World;</hi> all this muſt be kept down in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wicked in his Pride doth perſecute the Poor; but are they not taken in their Devices that they have imagined,</hi> Pſal. 10.2.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord hid them that feared him, in the ſecret of his Preſence, from the Pride of Man, and kept them ſecretly in a Pavillion, from the ſtrife of Tongues,</hi> Pſal. 31.20.</p>
               <p>And alſo <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Pride compaſſeth the wicked as a Chain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they ſpeak loftily; and they ſet their Mouths againſt Heaven; but the Lord caſts down ſuch to Deſtruction, and ſaves the Righteous that fears him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo you may ſee how <hi>Pride</hi> was teſtified againſt by Chriſt and his Prophets, and the holy Men of God, both in the Old and New Teſtament, ſince Man and Woman fell from the Image of God; and therefore all is to fear the Lord, and learn of Chriſt Jeſus, who is meek and low in Heart.</p>
               <p>For it is ſaid, That <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s <hi>Heart was tender, and he humbled himſelf before the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if my People,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The effects of true Humility.</note> 
                  <hi>which are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my Face, and turn from their wicked Ways; then will I hear from Heaven, and forgive them their Sins, and heal the Land; and mine Eyes ſhall be opened, and mine Ear attentive to their Prayer;</hi> this is the Comfort of the humble, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord forgets not the cry of the humble,</hi> Pſal. 9.12. Again <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ariſe O Lord, lift up thy Hand, forget not the humble: Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their Hearts, and wilt cauſe thine Ear to hear,</hi> Pſal. 10.12, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord, who Inhabits Eternity, whoſe Name is Holy, ſaith, I dwell in the High and Holy Places: And alſo with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit; to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Hearts of the Contrite Ones,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. Here is Joy and Comfort to the Humble. And <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>God gives Grace to the Humble, but he reſiſteth the Proud,</hi> James 4.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the Mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</hi> and be <hi>cloathed with Humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6.</p>
               <p>So you may ſee how <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud,</hi> and <hi>dwells with the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as is teſtified, both in the Old Teſtament and the New. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelf as this little Child, the ſame ſhall be greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So here you may ſee Chriſt, and the Prophets, and the Apoſtles taught Humility, and judged Pride. And again <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted, and he that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed,</hi> Luke 14.11. and 18.14.</p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:96751:261"/>
               <p>And therefore learn of Chirſt, who is <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>low</hi> in Heart: For he rules in the Hearts of the Humble, who is <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>Shepherd</hi> to feed them, and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to overſee them, and an Everlaſting <hi>Father,</hi> who begets Man and Woman up into the Image of God, and an Everlaſting Prince of Peace.</p>
               <p>And ſo all that are in true Humility, are the true Subjects of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and all the Children of Pride are ſubject to the Prince of the Air, the God of the World, who is the King of Pride, in whom there is no Truth.</p>

               <p>THE Lord forbids his People, by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to follow them,<note place="margin">Not to follow the People in their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> nor to learn the way of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> for the Cuſtoms of the People were vain, and they did not only deck themſelves, but they alſo decked their Images and Idols; and God's People were not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at the Signs of Heaven, in the Old Covenant; for the Heathen was diſmayed at them; much leſs in the New Covenant ſhould the true Chriſtians not be diſmayed at them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And again, doth not <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cry againſt the Paintings and Deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Judah?</hi> And though <hi>Judah rent her Face with painting, yet her Lovers would deſpiſe her.</hi> And this was when they forſook God, and followed other Lovers; and therefore God's Anger was againſt them in the Old Covenant; much more in the New, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p>And it is true, God did deck the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Old Covenant with outward things; but when they played the <hi>Harlot</hi> with them, and decked their Images with them, the <hi>Lord's Anger</hi> was againſt them, as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16.15, 16.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Hoſea</hi> cries out againſt the <hi>Jews decking of themſelves with Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Jewels, and going after other Lovers, and forgetting the Lord,</hi> Hoſea 2.13.

               <p>And you may ſee how the Lord ſent <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to cry againſt their <hi>Haughtineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtretched out Necks,</hi> and <hi>wanton Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Tincklings,</hi>

               <p>Now if ſuch things was teſtified againſt in the Old Covenant, then ſurely much more in the New.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Revelation</hi> 17 &amp; 18 Chapters, you may ſee how the <hi>Whore</hi> deck'd her ſelf, <hi>who drank the Blood of the Martyrs;</hi> but at her fall God's People ſung <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to <hi>uſe this World, and not abuſe it; for the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Saints, <hi>Not to faſhion themſelves according to their former Luſts, in their ignorance; but as Chriſt, who had called them was Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 14.</p>
               <p>So ſee what a Care the Apoſtle had, leſt that they ſhould go into their former Luſts of Ignorance.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Philippians, Their Converſations was in Heaven, from whence we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile Bodies, that they may be faſhioned like unto his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body,</hi> Philip. 3.21.</p>

               <p>And did not <hi>Zephaniah</hi> ſay, <hi>The Lord would puniſh all ſuch as were cloathed with ſtrange Apparrel?</hi> Zeph. 1.8.</p>
               <p>But firſt they were cloathed Inwardly in Tranſgreſſion before they cloathed Outwardly with the ſtrange Apparrel.</p>

               <p>And you may ſee that the firſt Apparrel that <hi>Adam</hi> made after Tranſgreſſion was of <hi>Figg Leaves,</hi> and then God made them Coats of Skins: But now People are ſo far degenerated from that, and have gotten ſo far into the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, that they know not what to put on.</p>
               <p>And their Life is below the <hi>Lillies,</hi> and the <hi>Fowles</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Fowles of the Air do not ſow, nor reap, nor gather into Barnes: And the Lillies they toil not, neither do they ſpin; but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father feeds and cloaths them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Chriſt alſo ſaith (ſpeaking to People) <hi>That ye are much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Fowles of the Air, or the Lillies: And therefore take ye no thought what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, or wherewith ye ſhall be cloathed; for after theſe things the Gentiles do ſeek; for your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that you have need of all theſe things; but firſt ſeek ye the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee how Chriſt is reſtoring People up into the <hi>Image</hi> of God, out of the Thoughts and Cares of the <hi>Heathen;</hi> for God took care of Man and Woman before he made them.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle exhorted <hi>Timothy,</hi> how the <hi>Women ſhould adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with modeſt Apparrel,</hi>

               <p>And <hi>James,</hi> he reproves and and exhorts ſuch, whoſe Eye and Eſteem was to the <hi>Gold Ring, and goodly Apparel, more than the poor in

               <p>And <hi>Peter,</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. exhorts the <hi>Saints</hi> how to adorn themſelves:<note place="margin">The Adorning of the Holy Women.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſe Adorning, let it not be the outward Adorning, of plaiting the Hair, or wearing of Gold, and putting on of Apparrel. But let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible; even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit: Which is in the ſight of God of great Price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For after this manner, in old Times, the holy Women alſo, who truſted in God, adorned themſelves. And this ought to be the Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the New Covenant. And though you may ſay, The <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Hebrews</hi> adorned themſelves with Jewels, and they did adorn the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the New Covenant theſe things were forbidden: And they were to adorn the Temple of the Heart, and not to defile that, and to know the hidden Man of the Heart, which is not corruptible. And therefore look into all your Hearts, and ſee if you can find any thing there, which is not corruptible, and to put off the old Man with his Deeds; with the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life; which is not of the Father, but of the World.</p>
               <p>And this old Man delights in the glory of the World, which muſt be put off. And all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the New Covenant muſt put on the New Man, that is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of God that created him, which walks and ſerves God in the New and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Way; who is born again, not of corruptible <hi>Seed,</hi> but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible <hi>Seed,</hi> by the Word of God; and feed upon the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Milk, and Wine, and Water, and Bread, and the incorruptible Fleſh and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wears the fine Linnen, the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the incorruptible Cloathing. And this is the Birth born of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>enters into the incorruptible Kingdom of God,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 3.5. and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in <hi>Chapter</hi> 4.22.<note place="margin">To put off out vain Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> To put off their former Converſation, <hi>the old Man, which is corruptible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful Luſts; and be renewed in the Spirit of your Minds; that is out of the Fall of</hi> Adam. And that ye put on the New Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. So here Man comes to know his firſt Creation, and his Degeneration; ſo always to ſee the New Man put on, which is in Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs; and the old Man put off, with all his vain Deckings, Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, and Cloathings, which is not acceptable both in the ſight of God and his People.</p>
               <p>And ſo all in the New Covenant are to be conformable to the Image of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. For all hath been conformed long enough to the Image of <hi>Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We all behold with open face, as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord; and are changed into the ſame image from Glory to Glory;</hi> even as by the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. So every one are to mind this happy and bleſſed Change.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus, and make no proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſt thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.14. And as every one hath received the Lord Jeſus, ſo walk in him, and then you will

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: Old things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and all things become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> Chap. 2.8. That they were not to follow the Rudiments of the World, for they were not after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And ſo People are not to follow the World's Rudiments, but <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you may ſee, how the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not to Luſt and tempt God, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did.</note> and the mixt Multitude, luſted after the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And the Lord ſmote them with a grievous Plague, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.

               <p>And again <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>They luſted exceedingly in the Wilderneſs, and tempted God in the Deſart. And he gave them their Requeſt, but ſent leanneſs into their Souls,</hi> Pſalm 106.14, 15.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the New Covenant the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, Theſe things were for our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things; as they alſo luſted 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. And <hi>Solomon</hi> exhorts to keep from the evil Woman, from the flattery of the Tongue of a ſtrange Woman. Luſt not after her Beauty in thy Heart, neither let her take thee with her Eye-lids. <hi>For by means of a whoriſh Woman, a Man is brought to a piece of Bread: And the Adulterous will hunt for thy precious Life,</hi> Prov. 6.26.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> not only forbids Adultery, but Luſt alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And again <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Cares of the World, and the Love of other things choaks the Word, and it becomes unfruitful to them,</hi> Mark 4.19.</p>
               <p>And you may ſee what became of ſuch, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. Who when they knew God, they glorified him not, as God; neither were thankful: How at laſt God gave them up, when they forſook him, through the Luſt of their Hearts. And there you may ſee what Evils they run into. And alſo you may ſee in <hi>Jude</hi> 16.18. How he declares againſt Murderers, and Complainers, and Mockers, who walked after their ungodly Luſts.</p>
               <p>And in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. there the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>James</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Wars and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings came from the Luſts.</note> War and Fightings came from the Luſts, that warred in their Members.

               <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Grace of God, which brings Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men.

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:96751:263"/>them that call on the Name of the Lord out of a pure Heart. And ſuch Teachers who had the Form of Godlineſs, but deny the Power which the Saints were to turn away from; thoſe were them that led ſilly People Captive, laden with Sin and divers Luſts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. and 3.5. And ſuch as could not abide ſound Doctrine, but after their own Luſts, ſhall heap to themſelves Teachers, having Itching Ears; they turn away their Ears from the Truth and Grace that comes by Jeſus Chriſt (which ſhould teach them to bring their Salvation) and from the Spirit of God, which they ſhould walk in,<note place="margin">To walk in the Spirit.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If ye walk in the Spirit</hi> (mark, in the Spirit) <hi>ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. And the Apoſtle further ſaith, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſs his Veſſel in Sanctification and Honour, and not in the Luſts of Concupiſcence, even as the Gentiles which know not God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.4.</p>
               <p>If a Man purge himſelf from theſe things, <hi>he ſhall be a Veſſel unto honour, and ſanctified, and meet for his Maſters uſe, and prepared for every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.21. But they that will be rich, fall into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Snares, and into many fooliſh hurtful Luſts, which drowns Men in Deſtruction and Perdition. <hi>But the Man of God is to fly theſe things, and follow after Righteouſneſs, Godlineſs, Faith, Love Patience and Meekneſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.11. <hi>And they that are Chriſt's, have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p>And Haughtineſs and High-mindedneſs was forbidden both by God and his People. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The afflicted People the Lord will ſave. And his Eyes are upon the haughty, to bring them down,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.28.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; and my Soul is like a weaned Child,</hi> Pſalm 131.2. Then he was fit for the Kingdom God. And again <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>God will ſave his afflicted People, but will bring down high looks,</hi> Pſalm 18.27.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Before Deſtruction, the Heart of Man is haughty; and before Honour, is Humility,</hi> Prov. 18.21.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declared againſt the Haughtineſs of the Daughters of <hi>Zion, Iſaiah</hi> 3. And how the haughty People of the Earth do lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, becauſe they had tranſgreſſed God's Laws, and changed his Ordinances.</p>

                  <hi>That they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> again tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> That <hi>the heady high-minded are lovers of Pleaſure more than lovers of God.</hi> And daily Experience ſhews; as you may ſee at large the Fruits of ſuch, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. And therefore all thoſe things the Faithful are to ſhun, and to be kindly affectioned one to another, <hi>with brotherly Love, and in Honour preferring one another,</hi> Rom. 12.10. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to be perfectly joined together, in the ſame Mind, and in the ſame Judgment; that they might all ſpeak the ſame thing: So that there may be no Diviſion among them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>And again,<note place="margin">To be of one Mind, and to live in Peace.</note> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be Perfect, be of good Comfort, be of one Mind, live in Peace. And the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with you. For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews or Gentiles, Bond or Free:</hi> And have been all made to drink into one Spirit, and the Spirit of the Prophets, are ſubject to the Prophets. <hi>For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. &amp; 14.32, 33. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> That they ſhould be of one Accord, and of one Mind; and ſaid, <hi>Let nothing be done in ſtrife, or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of Mind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 23. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Be of one Mind towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not mind high things, and to be wiſe in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, but condeſcend to Men of low eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>And the God of Patience and Conſolation grant you to be like minded all towards one another, according to Chriſt Jeſus: That ye may with one mind, and one mouth glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 15.5, 6, 7. <hi>For God hath given to his People the Spirit of Power, and of Love, and a ſound Mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 17.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt General Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>Be ye all of one Mind, and have Compaſſion one of another, love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. how <hi>he ſerved the Lord in all humility of Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is a Mark of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples (as he ſaith) <hi>if they love one another, and love Enemies.</hi> And ſo all that are Believers in him, are to love one another as he hath loved us, who hath laid down his Life for us.</p>
               <p>And therefore all are to deny themſelves; yea, and to offer all up for him.</p>
               <p>And whatſoever you do, do it in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>

               <head>A Teſtimony out of the Old Teſtament and New, of the Lord ſending his Prophets to declare his Judgments againſt the Diſobedience and Pride of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and how his Judgments were fulfilled upon them that did not Repent; and how the Apoſtle did admoniſh and reprove ſuch as went into Pride and the Faſhions of the World.</head>

                  <hi>THE Lord ſaith,</hi> Becauſe the Daughters of <hi>Zion</hi> are Haughty,<note place="margin">The Pride of the Daughters of <hi>Zion.</hi>
                  </note> and walk with ſtretched forth Necks and wanton Eyes, walking and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as they go, and making a tinkling with their Feet; therefore the Lord will ſmite with a Scab the Crown of the Head of the Daughters of <hi>Zion;</hi> and the Lord will diſcover their ſecret Parts; in that Day the Lord will take away the Bravery of their Tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and their Cauls, and their Round Tyres, like the Moon, the Chains <hi>(mark the Chains)</hi> and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers, the Bonnets, and the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Legs, and the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Ear-rings, the Rings, and Noſe-Jewels, the Changable Suits of Apparrel, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and the Wimbles, and the Criſping-pins, and Glaſſes, and the fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and the Hoods, and the Vails. And it ſhall come to paſs, that inſtead of ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtink; and inſtead of a girdle, a rent; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of well ſet hair, baldneſs; and inſtead of a ſtomacher, a girding of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath; and burning inſtead of beauty: Thy Men ſhall fall by the Sword, and thy Mighty in the War; and her Gates ſhall lament and mourn, and ſhe being deſolate ſhall ſit on the Ground, <hi>Iſa. 3.16, to the end. And you may read in 2</hi> Kings <hi>17. how that the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were carried into Captivity in</hi> Aſſyria; <hi>for the King of</hi> Aſſyria <hi>beſieged</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, <hi>and after three Years Beſieging, he took it and carrried away the</hi> Ten Tribes <hi>of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>into the Land of</hi> Aſſyria. <hi>And</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>according to the Word of the Lord, went to the Propheteſs, and ſhe conceived and bore a Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Before the Child ſhould have the Knowledge to cry, My Father and my Mother, the Riches of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and the Spoil of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſhall be taken away by the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> Iſa. <hi>8.3, 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now here you may ſee what a Deſtruction came upon</hi> Samaria <hi>and the</hi> Jews, <hi>becauſe of their Rebellion and Diſobedience,</hi>

                  <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> Behold the Day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud, yea, all that do Wickedly, ſhall be as Stubble; and the Day that cometh ſhall burn them up,<note place="margin">The proud as Stubble.</note> ſaith the Lork of Hoſt, that it ſhall leave them neither Root nor Branch: But unto them that fear my Name, ſhall the Son of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his Wings, and ye ſhall go forth, and grow up as Calves in the Stall, <hi>Mal. 4.1, 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> in the Seed of Life that is over all,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 398.</note> whom the Lord doth ſupport, and hath ſupported by his Eternal <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> to ſtand for his Glory; be valiant for his Truth and his Name upon the Earth, who is God <hi>All-ſufficient</hi> and <hi>Almighty,</hi> over all to ſupport you all, and to ſupply you with all things needful. Now <hi>dear Friends,</hi> it is not only given you to believe in the Name of Chriſt, but alſo to ſuffer for his Name ſake; ſo you ſee and know,<note place="margin">To ſuffer for Chriſt is the Gift of God, as well as Faith.</note> 'tis a Gift given you to believe, and a Gift to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake, and his Righteouſneſs; but however, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be ye wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves;</hi> for Chriſt's Believers are as Sheep or Lambs among Wolves, he hath declared that they ſhall be brought before Counſels, and before Rulers, for his Name ſake: But Chriſt bids his Diſciples, <hi>Take no Thought what they ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame Hour what ye ſhall ſpeak: for it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you;</hi> and this <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is ſufficient to truſt to, for it ſhall anſwer all, if they have Ears to hear, and comfort his People, his Lambs and Sheep. And Chriſt further ſaid, ſpeaking to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye ſhall be hated of all Men for my Name ſake; but he that endureth to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved; and he that heareth you</hi> (to wit, <hi>Chriſt's Sheep</hi>) <hi>heareth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me</hi> (namely <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Father,</hi> Matth. 10. Luke 10. <hi>And the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord;</hi> for Chriſt the Lord and Maſter of the Sheep was deſpiſed; ſo it is enough for the Deſciple that he be as his Maſter,<note place="margin">The Deſciple is not above his Maſter.</note> and the Servant as his Lord; <hi>for if they call the Maſter of the Houſe</hi> (namely <hi>Chriſt</hi>) Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, <hi>how much more ſhall they call them of his Houſhold? But the very Hairs of your Head are all numbered: Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many Sparrows, and not one of them ſhall fall to the Ground without the heavenly Father.</hi> See here Chriſt encourages his Lambs and Sheep; therefore ſtand in his Will. And if the Lord ſuffer you (who are his Lambs, and Sheep, and are as Doves and Chickens, that Chriſt hath gathered under his Wings, and none are able to pluck you out of his Hands (his Power) who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him; and now if it be the Will of the Lord to try you, his Lambs and Sheep, by ſpoiling of your outward Goods, as he did his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> and others of his Servants and Children, in the days of the Apoſtles, who took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods; and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> by Faith choſe rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to injoy the Pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the Reproaches of Chriſt greater Riches than all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for he had an Eye to the Recompence of Reward; as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>And therefore conſider how <hi>Noah, Lot, Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> by Faith ſerved the Lord, and went through Sufferings and Trials;
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:96751:266"/>and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, through Faith went through great Sufferings and Impriſonments; and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Three Children,</hi> paſſed through great Sufferings and Trials by Faith; ſo Faith was their Victory, which was the Gife of God, which Chriſt is the Author and Finiſher of; and you read in the Days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, what Sufferings and Impriſonments they were carried through by Faith; and ſince the Apoſtles Days, how all the Martyrs were carried through great Sufferings and Impriſonments by their Faith, which was their Victory; in which Faith they pleaſed God, and had Victory over the Devil; and in which Faith they were all in Unity.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>dear Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> if it doth pleaſe the Lord to try you, who are the Believers in the Light, and Children of the Light and the Day of Chriſt: I ſay again, if it pleaſe the Lord, and it be his Will, to try you in ſtinking Priſons and Dungeons, Bride-wells, Houſes of Correction, and ſuffer you to be put in ſuch places, who are his Sheep and Lambs,<note place="margin">The Lord can Sanctifie all our Sufferings to us and make them pleaſant.</note> Plants and Branches; I ſay, the Lord can ſanctifie all ſuch places for his People, his Children, his Sons and Daughters, and make all pleaſant to them: For his Sheep and People cannot go any where from the Lord, for the Lord and his Preſence is with them, and the Angel of his Preſence faves them; and therefore ſuch Goals and Dungeons, bridewells, Houſes of Correction, which are for evil Doers, if the Lord do try, or ſuffer his People to be put in ſuch places, yet his People are all in the Hand, and under the Wings of Chriſt, and he can ſanctifie all ſuch places to them; and you, in that State, are to pray for the Enemies that put you there; and if they curſe and hate you, you are to bleſs them, and to do good unto them, and you are to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you, and love your Enemies, that you may be Children of your Father which is in Heaven; <hi>for he maketh the Sun to ſhine on the Evil and on the Good, and cauſeth his Rain to fall on the Juſt and on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Believers, <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good;</hi> ſo you holding faſt that which is good, with that you cna try all things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or bad; <hi>and be not overcome with Evil, but overcome Evil with Good;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To over come Evil with Good.</note> This is the Command. So it is the Good that muſt overcome the Evil; and what hath the Children of God to overcome the Evil withal, but the Good? Therefore, then all muſt hold faſt that which is Good, if that with the Good they overcome the Evil, and can try all things; but when any do go from the Good in themſelves, then they are not like with it to ovecome the Evil, nor with it try all things, without holding faſt that which is Good; for without it you cannot try all things, nor overcome the Evil, except you hold faſt that which is Good, which was before the Dad was, or Evil either; for by the Good, Evil is overcome, and with it you can try all things, whether they are Good or Bad; and a good Man; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor; his Righteouſneſs endureth for ever; his Horn ſhall be exalted with honur. They that chuſe the things that pleaſe the Lord, and keep his Covenant, even them will I give a Name in my Houſe, and within my Walls, a Place and a Name, better than of Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord, and I will give them an everlaſting Name, which ſhall not be cut off,</hi> Iſa. 56. So you may ſee how the Lord doth encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his People to walk in the Truth, in Faithfulneſs to him; for the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:96751:266"/>Lord hath loved his People with an everlaſting Love; therefore with loving-kindneſs hath he, and doth he draw them unto himſelf, to ſerve and worſhip him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that believeth on him hath everlaſting Life.</hi> Mark, hath it, as in <hi>John.</hi> And again Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that drinketh of the Water that I give, ſhall never thirſt; but the Water that I ſhall give, ſhall be in him as a well of Water ſpringing up to Eternal Life.</hi> So every one mind this Well in you, who have drank of the Water which Chriſt hath given you.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">God will puniſt them who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>God will puniſh them that diſobey his Goſpel with an everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.9. Here you may ſee everlaſting Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Wicked, that diſobey the Goſpel; and everlaſting Life, to them that believe and obey the Boſpel of Chriſt. Now they that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Goſpel of Chriſt, refuſe their own Comfort and Joy of Life and Salvation; which Goſpel is the Power of God, which is preach'd to every Creature under Heaven to believe and obey; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happy are you who have received it, and obeyed it, which brings Life and Immortality to Light in you; that you ſee over the Enemy which darkened you, and are now become Heirs of this comfortable and joyful Goſpel of Life and everlaſting Salvation; in which ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel you have an everlaſting golrious Fellowſhip; and in this everlaſting Goſpel, you can praiſe the everlaſting God, that reigns over all from everlaſting to everlaſting. And all that are of the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>David</hi> can ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be God from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to everlaſtin; and let all the People ſay,</hi> Amen. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> And further can ſay, <hi>That the Mercy of the Lord is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, upon all them that fear him and his Righteouſneſs unto the Children of Men,</hi> Pſalm 103.17. For the Lord God he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not, he is the ſame that he was, who inhabits Eternity, and dwells in the humble Heart; and therefore you humble Ones, fear and ſerve and worſhip him. And keep under the Wing of Chriſt, and in him your Sanctuary and Saviour, who deſtroys the Deſtroyer, and is over all the Firſt and Laſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>And now, <hi>Dear Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> my deſire is, That you may ſhew forth the Nature of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Vertue</hi> and the <hi>Life,</hi> in which the Nobility of true Chriftianity is ſeen and manifeſted in your peaceable, modeſt and vertuous Behaviour, before the Powers that you are brought before; and that none are to queſtion or take thought what they are to ſay; for it ſhall be given you in that ſame Hour what ye ſhall ſpeak, ſaith <hi>Chriſt; Whoſoever therefore ſhall confeſs me bfeore Men, hism will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in Heaven: For with the Heart Man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 10.10. <hi>And every Tongueſhall
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:96751:267"/>confeſs to God,</hi> Rom. 14.11. And again, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, That <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father,</hi> Philip. 2.10. So we cannot but confeſs and declare what our Eyes have ſeen,<note place="margin">Every Tongue ſhall confeſs to Chriſt.</note> and our Ears have heard, and our Hands have handled of the Word of <hi>Life</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, by whom all things were made and created.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt and his Diſciples, who often met on Mountains, and in the Wilderneſs, and on the Sea-ſide, and in Ships, and ſometimes in Houſes. We do not read, that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> called Chriſt and his Apoſtles Meetings <hi>Routs</hi> or <hi>Riots,</hi> though the <hi>Jews</hi> and the chief <hi>Prieſts</hi> were bad enough againſt them.</p>
               <p>For, all <hi>Routs</hi> and <hi>Riots</hi> are out of the Spirit of <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſo is Misbehaviour of all People; for the <hi>Truth</hi> is peaceable, and brings People into peaceable Lives and Converſations, out of Routs and Riots, and Misbehaviour; and in Peace they worſhip God; and they worſhip God in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> an din this holy pure <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Unity and Bond of Peace, and is the Bond of good Behaviour, and of holy Walking and Talking, and it is the Bond of peaceable Lives and Converſations of all that worſhip God in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and walk in the New and Living Way, and keep in the pure, holy and undefiled Religion.</p>
               <p>And ſo, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> be of one Mind, and heart, and Spirit, and God Almighty Arm you with Patience and Humility; who is God All-ſufficient, to give you Dominion with his Power, and to ſupport you.

And Satan the old Serpent ſhall go out to deceive the Nations, which are in the four Quarters of the Earth, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mgog,</hi> to gather them together to Battel; the Number of whom is as the Sand of the Sea (ſo here is a gathering together by the Devil) and they went upon the breadth of the Earth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City, <hi>and Fire came down from God out of Heaven and devoured them; ſo theſe were gathered together by the</hi> Devil, <hi>the Deſtroyer, was deſtroyed by God the</hi> Saviour <hi>of his People,</hi> Rev. 20.8.</p>

               <p>And the Lord ſcattered <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that mighty Hunters gathering, <hi>who gathered up People together to build Babel, and confounded them,</hi> Gen. 10.11.

And Chriſt Jeſus ſaith, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>That there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other: For there is no other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4.12. <hi>but by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> So here is the Saints true Gathering in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>Second Adam; and none is able to pluck them out of his hand,</hi> John 10.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Woman bruiſes the <hi>Serpent's</hi> Head, and Chriſt through Death deſtroys Death, and the Devil the Power of Death; and ſo doth reconcile all things, both in Heaven and in the Earth into one.</p>
               <p>The Devil abode not in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo he became a Devil,<note place="margin">The Devil not abiding in the <hi>Truth</hi> became an Enemy.</note> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, and a Serpent, and Enemy, and a Satan, and Adverſary to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and to <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that God made in his <hi>Image,</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſo he became an Enemy, and Adverſary, and Deſtroyer, who is out of the Truth, and abode not in it, in whom there is no Truth, and ſo is called the Old Serpent, and Satan, and Devil, Tempter, and falſe Accuſer; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> through Death deſtroys Death and the Devil, the Power of Death.</p>
               <p>And when the <hi>Jews</hi> went from the Truth, they became Enemies and Adverſaries to it, and Deſtroyers of the Righteous, and the Juſt; yea, they were Adverſaries, and Accuſers, and Enemies to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> called the <hi>Jews,</hi> Vipers and Serpents, and ſaid to them that made a Profeſſion of the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but were gone from the Truth of them, that they were of their Father the Devil, and his Works and Luſts they would do.</p>
               <p>And here the <hi>Jews</hi> that went out of the Truth, did not they become as Serpents, Enemies, Satans, Adverſaries, and <hi>Judas's,</hi> Betrayers, and of the Devil, Deſtroyers of the Juſt?</p>
               <p>And when they which are called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> became haters of the <hi>Light,</hi> and Walkers deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of Grace, Deſpiſers of the Word in their Hearts, and erred from the Truth and the true Faith, and profeſſed the Form of Godlineſs, but denied the Power thereof, and ſo denied the <hi>Spirit</hi> ot true <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Theſe became as Serpents, Enemies, Satan, Adverſaries to true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and of the Devil, that ſeek to deſtroy it, and <hi>Judas's,</hi> Betrayers of it, and of the Righteous and the Juſt, where-ever it appeared to the unjuſt: And this hath been the Work of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that did not abide in the Truth in all Ages, to be as Enemies, Adverſaries and <hi>Judas's,</hi> Betrayers,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:96751:268"/>who ſeek to deftroy the Truth; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Truth, doth deſtroy that deſtroying <hi>Spirit,</hi> who is the Saviour.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which were the greateſt outward Profeſſors, and appliers of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to themſelves upon the Earth, and yet the greateſt Perſecutors of the holy Men and Women, and the Lord's Prophets upon the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>Jerſalem</hi> was the chiefeſt Place of Worſhip, and the chiefeſt City among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the greateſt Place of Perſecution, and yet the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wept over this City, and would have gathered theſe perſecuting Profeſſors (who were without poſſeſſing of the Life of what they did profeſs) but they would not come to him that they might have Life.</p>
               <p>And theſe perſecuting <hi>Jews, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>Te compaſs Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte, and when he is made he is two-fold mord the Child of Hell,</hi> Matth. 23.</p>

                  <hi>DEar Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 401.</note> who is your holy, heavenly Rock and Foundation of God, that ſtandeth ſure, who was the Foundation and the Rock of his <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God, that ſtandeth ſure.</note> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days, and is now. You may ſee how <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent <hi>John</hi> tho Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his <hi>Church,</hi> and ſaith in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. <hi>I know thy Works: Behold, I have ſet before thee an open Door, and no Man can ſhut it: For thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my Word, and haſt not denied my Name. Behold, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan (which ſay they are Jews, and are not, but do lye) behold, I will make them to come and worſhip before they feet, and to know that I have loved thee: Becauſe thou haſt kept the Word of my Patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the World, to try them that dwell upon the face of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you may ſee what Comfort the Sons and Daughters of God have, that keep the Word of Patience, what a Door is opened to them of the Bleſſings, Mercies and Riches of God, which no Man can ſhut from them. And they which ſaid they were <hi>Jews, and were not,</hi> or ſuch as make outward Profeſſion of the Words of Truth, and Form of Godlineſs, and are not in the Truth; ſuch the Lord ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan,</hi> &amp;c. So here you may ſee the Lord would have his Children, his Church, to take notice, what he will make of them that do not poſſeſs. the Truth, namely, <hi>The Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> he will bow them down, and make them to know, He loveth his faithful People.</p>
               <p>And all ſuch as went out from the Church of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Thoſe who go from the Church maifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days, which were not of them; and <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that went out from the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c. and all they that ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Apoſtles days, from the Church of Chrift, and all they that ſeparated themſelves now, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are gone out from the Church of Chriſt, have maniſeft they were not of them: They that went out from the Church of Chruſt, in the Apoſtles days, and ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from them; and all they that go from the Church of Chriſt now, and ſeparate themſelves from them, they have erred from the Word of Patience, and have not kept that; but ſuch are gone into Temptations of the World, and are become as the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and like Raging Waves of the Sea, <hi>Satan's</hi> Fruits and Works they do manifeſt; ſo that by their Fruits it is known of what <hi>Synagogue</hi> they are, and have and do, ſufficiently diſcover it in all Ages, how that Patience is worn out, and weareth out, and that they have not kept the Word of Patience; and none ſuch are like to preach the Word of God, and the Word of Life, and the Word of Patience, and the Word of Wiſdom, that liveth, and abideth, and endureth for ever, that keep not the Word of Patience; for, how can ſuch keep the Word of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, or the Word of Life, or the Word of Wiſdom, when they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves, and go out from the Church of ſhriſt, and are not
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:96751:270"/>of it? For had they been of it, they would have continued with the Church of Chriſt, in the Word of Life, Wiſdom and Patience: But now they do manifeſt themſelves to be out of the gentle Wiſdom of God,<note place="margin">The Fruits of hem who ere not led by the Wiſdom of God.</note> and out of the Word of Patience, in a Raſh, Haſty, Furious, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, Malicious, Hateful, Lying, Defaming, Slandering, Gain-ſaying and Envious <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Cain, Corah</hi> and <hi>Ham;</hi> and the Fruits of this Spirit is manifeſt ſufficiently now, as in other Ages, to them that live in the Word of Life, Wiſdom and Patience; by which Word all God's Children are born again of the Immortal Seed, and feeds upon the Milk of the Word; by which Word all things were made and created; by which Word all God's People are reconciled to God; which Word liveth, and abideth, and endureth for ever.</p>
               <p>Now as there isa growth and adding to Faith, and Vertue, and Knowledge, and Temperance, and Godlineſs, and Patience, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Kindneſs, and Charity, as God's Children are led by the Spirit of God, in which they have Unity, and it is the Bond of their Peace: So as there is an erring from the Spirit of God, there is a degenerating from Vertue, Kindneſs, and true Knowledge, and Godlineſs, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and Patience, and Brotherly Kindneſs, and Charity, this we have ſeen both now in this Age, as in the Days of the Apoſtles; and this degenerating Spirlt, whoſe Patience is worn out, they may get all the good Words in the Scriptures, Words of the Spirit, Words of Truth, Words of Faith, and the Promiſes, and apply them to their Impatient Spirits, but they will loſe the Comfort of them: But the Word of Life, the Word of Wiſdom, the Word of Patience will never be worn out, but liveth, and abideth, and endureth for ever.</p>

               <pb n="531" facs="tcp:96751:270"/>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of Chriſt, the <hi>Philipians, I count all things but loſs for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Knowledge of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>that I may know him and the Power of his Reſurrection, and the Fellowſhip of his Sufferings; being made conformable unto his Death:</hi> Which every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould be of the ſame mind, as this Holy Apoſtle was. So here you may ſee the Apoſtle exhorts People to <hi>Suffer with Chriſt,</hi> and for him, but not as Murderers, Thieves, Evil-doers, and Buſie-bodies in other Mens matters. And as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Depart from the evil, and do good; ſeek peace, and purſue it; keep thy Tongue from evil, and thy Lips from ſpeaking guile: For the wicked have ſet their Mouths againſt the Heavens, and their Tongues walk through the Earth: But be not as the Horſe and the Mule, whoſe Mouth muſt be held with the Bit and the Bridle.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will take heed unto my Ways, that I Sin not with my Tongue: I will keep my Mouth with a bit, while the Wicked is before me.</hi> And this is good Advice, that God's People be not enſnared by the Wicked's Snare: And therefore it is good for all God's People to be careful and wiſe, that none do ſuffer as Buſie-bodies in other Mens matters, or as Evil-doers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let their Sufferings be foi Righteouſneſs ſake, and with Chriſt, that they may reign with him. And keep out the <hi>Athenians</hi> Spirit, ſpending their time in hearing and telling of News, which the World is full of, in whom your Trouble is; <hi>But in me ye have Peace,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And therefore as every one hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo walk in him, and let your Converſations be in him, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And bleſſed are they who ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake, and in whoſe Hearts there is no <hi>Enmity:</hi> And bleſſed are they that dwell in the Love of God, that can bear all things, and are in the Wiſdom of God, which is pure and peaceable. For Troubles, Afflictions, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Impriſonments, ſpoiling of Goods, and many Perils do attend God's People, by the World that lieth in Wickedneſs: And therefore it is good for all God's People to keep in <hi>Chriſt</hi> their <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> in whom they have Eternal <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And alſo God's People are exerciſed now (as in days paſt) with Trials and Perils by falſe <hi>Brethren,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in the Apoſtles day, ſuch as went from the <hi>Chruch,</hi> in <hi>Cain's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trials by falſe Brethren.</note> 
                  <hi>Corah's</hi> and <hi>Balaam's</hi> Way, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Fierce Deſpiſers, falſe Accuſers of thoſe that are good;</hi> and you may read in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. throughout, of ſuch as forſook the right <hi>Way,</hi> and of many following their <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ways, by reaſon of whom the Way of Truth was evil ſpoken of:</hi> And ſo it is now, as it was in the Apoſtles days. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church, <hi>You have heard ſay, that Anti-chriſts ſhould come; even now are there many Anti-chriſts: They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us; but they went out from us, that they might be manifeſt they were not of us,</hi> 1 John 2.18, 19. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did forewarn his Diſciples of theſe <hi>Anti-chriſts</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> that they ſhould be in wardly Ravening Wolves, and by the Fruits of their Trees they ſhould be known; to be of the Nature of the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and not of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> Such as theſe went from the <hi>Church</hi> (in the Apoſtles days) into

               <p>And the Sufferings, and Perils by falſe <hi>Brethren,</hi> have been more Grief many times to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than open Perſecution; for they cauſe the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> to be evil ſpoken of; that turn from the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> like the Dog to the Vomit, or the Sow to the Mire. And in the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, God preſerve all his People from all the biting devouring Dogs, and greedy Swine.</p>
               <p>And you read how Righteous <hi>Abel</hi> ſuffered by his falſe Brother <hi>Cain;</hi>

               <p>Now when God had raiſed up this Prophet,<note place="margin">Chriſt the Prophet.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> you ſee many of the <hi>Jews</hi> would not receive him, nor believe him, nor many would hardly hear him, though they were called <hi>Brethren;</hi> but they Mocked him, and Perſecuted him, and Blaſphemed him; and the <hi>Chief Prieſt</hi> gave Money to <hi>Juaas</hi> (one of his Diſciples) to betray him: And what became of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of <hi>Judas,</hi> that betrayed and perſecuted <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Prophets?</hi> And what became of all thoſe <hi>falſe Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Anti chriſts</hi> that went in <hi>Cain</hi>'s, <hi>Corah</hi>'s, <hi>Balaam</hi>'s and <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s Way?

<pb n="535" facs="tcp:96751:272"/>new Creatures in Chriſt.</hi> For to the new Creature, Chriſt is the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering once for all; and his Blood giveth Life in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and New Covenant, and taking Oaths and ſwearing to the Lord, and performing them to the Lord, this was in the Old Time, in the Old Covenant and Teſtament; and Chriſt hath aboliſhed that Law and Covenant,<note place="margin">Whatſoever is more than Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, cometh of Evil.</note> and thoſe Old Things that were in the Old Time. And in his New Covenant and New Teſtament, he ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your Yea, be Yea; and your Nay, Nay: Whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the New Covenant and New Teſtament, Circumciſion is of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of the Children of the New Covenant, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the Temples of the Living God; and none are ſaved or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Works and Righteouſneſs of the Law in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but by the Faith of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And ſo all the <hi>Figures, Shadows</hi> and <hi>Types,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all Figures and Types.</note> in the Old Teſtament and Covenant, Chriſt the <hi>Subſtance</hi> is come and aboliſhes them, and doth them away; and he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I make all things new.</hi> So the New Creature in Chriſt Jeſus, ſeeth the Old Things are paſt away, and all Things are become New. So the New Creature is the new Bottle, that holds the new Wine, he hath the new Garments; and a piece of new Cloth muſt not be ſewed in the Old Garment. So the old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and old Bottle, and old Wine, muſt be kept diſtinct from the new Garments, and new Cloth, and new Bottles, and new Wine. So the New Covenant, and New Teſtament, is diſtinct from the Old Covenant, and Old Teſtament: The New and Living Way in the New Teſtament, and New Covenant, is diſtinct from the Way in the Old Teſtament, and Old Covenant; and the new Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus, that beholds all things, are become new to them; and ſee that the old Things are paſt away from them: Here is a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the new Creatures and the old Creatures, that cry up the old Thing, and live in them; and the New, that crieth up the New, and liveth in them.</p>
               <p>And in the Old Teſtament, the outward <hi>Jews</hi> defended their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> by Carnal Weapons, and outward Armour; but in the New Teſtament, the Children of the New Covenant, their Armour and Weapons are Spiritual, not Carnal.</p>
               <p>And in the Old Teſtament, and Old Covenant, there was a Tribe of Prieſts that offered up outward Offerings and Sacrifices; but in the New Teſtament, the Children of the New Covenant are called, <hi>A Spiritual Houſhold, and a Royal and a holy Prieſthood, to offer Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Old Teſtament, and the Old Covenant, the Prieſthood was made by the Law of a Carnal Commandment; but Chriſt, our High-Prieſt, in the Teſtament, was made after the Power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Life. And the High-Prieſt in the Old Teſtament entered into the outward Sanctuary, called, <hi>The Holy Place, made with Hands;</hi> which Prieſthood and Sanctuary is aboliſhed and done away by Chriſt: But Chriſt in his New Teſtament, is entered into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the Preſence of God, for the Children of the New Teſtament, who do praiſe God through Jeſus Chriſt their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who makes their Peace betwixt them and God; for he that
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:96751:273"/>ſitteth on the Throne, maketh all things new, and reconciles to God.</p>
               <p>The Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Chriſt and his Church.</note> was partly a Figure of Chriſt, and partly of his Church: For, when Chriſt ſuffered the Temple of his Holy Body to be deſtroyed, and was raiſed again from the Dead, <hi>John</hi> 2.19. then Chriſt raiſed up us the Chriſtian Church; which is the true ſpiritual Houſe and Temple wherein God dwelleth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, and alſo the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings, ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.33. how that the Lord ſhould make <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Soul an Offering for Sin,<note place="margin">Chriſt's Soul an Offering for Sin.</note> who poured out his Soul unto Death; and the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall declare his Generation?</hi> Yet the Prophet ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed</hi> (namely <hi>Chriſt</hi>) and did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſee his Seed, his faithful Apoſtles and Diſciples? And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For both he that Sanctifieth</hi> (namely <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>and they who are Sanctified are all of one; for which cauſe Chriſt is not aſhamed to call them Brethren:</hi> So then they are of his <hi>Seed,</hi> which can preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and can declare his heavenly and holy <hi>Generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again he ſaith, <hi>I will declare thy Name among my Brethren:</hi> So here <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth his Believers his <hi>Brethren;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt our Brother.</note> and again he ſaith, <hi>Behold I, and the Children which God hath given me, are for Signs and for Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Iſrael;</hi> ſo they are now to all outward Profeſſors without Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.18. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall give you a Sign</hi> (namely, the outward <hi>Jews.</hi>) <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name</hi> Emanuel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23.</p>

                  </note> the <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> he was a <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and a <hi>Wonder,</hi> when he came; and he is a <hi>Sign</hi> and a <hi>Wonder</hi> to all outward Profeſſors of the Scripture, without Poſſeſſion, where he is revealed and manifeſt in his People; for he ſaith, <hi>Behold I, and the Children whom the Lord hath given me, are for Signs and for Wonders in Iſrael.</hi> So where <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of God, is revealed in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they come to be of his <hi>Seed, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Generation,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his <hi>Generation,</hi> they are for <hi>Signs,</hi> and for <hi>Wonders,</hi> and for <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-Stocks</hi> to all the outward Profeſſors of God, and Chriſt, and the Prophets and Apoſtles, without the Poſſeſſion of their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>Abraham was called a Friend of God,</hi> James 2.24.<note place="margin">We are the Friends of God if we keep his Commandments</note> And Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatever I command: Henceforth I call you not Servants, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant knoweth not what his Lord doth: But I have called you Friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</hi> Here Chriſt called his Diſciples ſometimes <hi>Friends,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Brethren,</hi> as before; as in <hi>John</hi> 15.19. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.12.</p>
               <p>And as many as received Chriſt, to them he gave Power to become the <hi>Sons</hi> of God; even to them that believed on his Name; <hi>which were born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God,</hi> John 1.12, 13. Theſe are they that declared the Generations of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold</hi> (or take notice) <hi>what manner of Love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God: Beloved,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:96751:273"/>now we are the Sons of God; therefore the World knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not,</hi> 1 John 3.1, 2. Here you may ſee the World know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God, nor his Sons: So it is no marvel, if the World that lieth in Wickedneſs, be haters of God, and haters of his Son, and Sons, but <hi>greater is he that is in God's Sons and Daughters, than he that is in the World;</hi> by which they do overcome the World, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <p>And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Job, When the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> Job 38.7. There was cauſe of Joy to hear that heavenly Harmony. <hi>And God hath Anointed Chriſt with Oil of Gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.9.</p>
               <p>Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his Houſe, as a Servant,</hi>

                  <hi>for a Teſtimony of theſe things which were to be ſpoken after</hi> (namely, the Subſtance, <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>but Chriſt as a Son is over his Houſe, whoſe we are</hi> (namely, that are the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> of God) as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6. So here is a diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Servant</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light;</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 12.36. So the way to become the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> is to believe in the <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Darkneſs, but now are ye Light in the Lord;</hi> walk as Children of the Light.</p>
               <p>And again, the Apoſtle writeth to the <hi>Theſſalonians, Ye are all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Light, and Children of the Day; we are not of the Night, nor of Darkneſs,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.5. Theſe were the Believers in the Light, that were become Children of the Light, and Day of Chriſt. And Chriſt ſaid unto ſuch, <hi>Ye are the Light of the World, and a City ſet on a Hill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To be Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rebuke.</note> 
                  <hi>that cannot be hid;</hi> and ſuch are to be blameleſs and harmleſs, the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe <hi>Generation, among whom ye ſhine as Lights in the World,</hi> Philip. 2.15. For as the Prophet ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. and Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children; in Righteouſneſs ſhall they be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: The Spirit it ſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirits that we are the Children of God; and if Children, then Heirs of God, and Joint Heirs with Chriſt: If ſo he that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together,</hi> namely, <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.14, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are Heirs of God, and Joint Heirs with Chriſt; ſuch can declare of his Generation; for they which are Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Truth declare of Chriſt's Generation; but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. For Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Nicodemus, Except a Man be born again of Water and the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Kingdom of God, nor enter into it: That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> John 3.3, 5, 6. <hi>For he that is born of the Spirit is perſecuted by him that is born of the Fleſh;</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is above, is the Mother of all them that are born of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and ſo are all the Children of God by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. and 4.26. So as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 3.6. <hi>That the Gentiles ſhould be Fellow Heirs of the ſame Body, and Partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,

               <p>
                  <hi>And God hath choſen the poor of this World rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him;</hi> as in <hi>James</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Chirſt ſoweth good Seed in the Heart.</note> 
                  <hi>He that ſoweth the Seed is the Son of Man, the Field is the World; the good Seed are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of the wicked One, the Enemy that ſoweth them is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Matth. 13.37, 38, 39. Here Chriſt maketh a diſtinction betwixt the two <hi>Seeds</hi> and the two <hi>Sowers;</hi> and the good <hi>Seed</hi> are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom of God, but the bad <hi>Seed</hi> muſt be caſt into the Fire, which are the Children of the wicked One. And Chriſt ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.11. <hi>The Seed is the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Being born again, not of Corruptible Seed, but of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth, and abideth, and indureth for ever;</hi> ſuch feed upon the Milk of the Word, and grow thereby, I <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. and 2.2.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him;</hi> and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God; in this the Children of God are manifeſt from the Children of the Devil; and in this the true Birth is manifeſt, and this Seed and Birth knows the Kingdom of Chriſt, and declares of his Generation, who is built upon him the heavenly Rock and Foundation; for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> aboliſhed Death, and hath brought <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> through his Glorious Everlaſting Goſpel, the Power of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">The Law ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till Chriſt came.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law ſerved, and it was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, till the Seed ſhould come,</hi> namely Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. And now Chriſt the Seeds-Man is come, who is the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſs ſake, to every one that believes; and they that Believe are all the Children of God by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham, In thy Seed ſhall all the Kindreds (or all the Families) of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Acts 3.25. Gen. 12.3. Acts 7.6. And this is the <hi>Seed</hi> that ſojourned in a ſtrange Land, and they that did evilly intreat this <hi>Seed,</hi> and bring it into Bondage, God did judge. And the Promiſes of God is ſure to all the <hi>Seed,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>And the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed; for theſe are the Children of the Kingdom,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8.</p>

               <p>Now, here you may ſee what was the Cauſe that the Earth ſhould not yield her ſtrength after it was tilled; and of <hi>Cain</hi>'s fear of being killed; and of building the City.</p>
               <p>And <hi>John</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Epiſtle. He that hateth his Brother, is a Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or a Man-ſlayer; and no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in them,</hi> 1 John 3.15.</p>

               <head>To all the holy Women that truſt in God, and do profeſs Godlineſs with good Works, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine in this Age, for them to read over and put in Practice.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FRiends,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 409.</note> 
                  <hi>I will therefore that Women adorn themſelves in modeſt Apparrel, with Shamefacedneſs and Sobriety, and not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or Coſtly Array,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Chriſtian Adorning.</note> 
                  <hi>but as becometh Women profeſſing Godlineſs with good Works,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.9, 10. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his General Epiſtle to the Church of Chriſt, to the Women, <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and wearing of Gold, and of putting on of Apparrel; but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not Corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of a great price; for after this manner in old time the holy Women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Now all Women may here conſider what is to be the Practice of ſuch Women that profeſs Godlineſs, and truſt in God, their Adorning is the hidden Man of the Heart, which is Incorruptible, and their Ornament is to of a <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of great Price;</hi> but thoſe Women whoſe outward Adorning is with broidered and plaited <hi>Heir,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi> and <hi>Coſtly Array:</hi> theſe have not the modeſt <hi>Apparrel,</hi> which become Modeſt, Sober, Shamefaced Women, that profeſs Godlineſs with good Works; but ſuch as are Unſober and Immodeſt, ſuch as look upon ſuch things to become them, are cloathed with corruptible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Spirits, that do not poſſeſt Godlineſs with good Works; and theſe outward Ornaments, as plaiting and broidering the Hair, and wearing of Gold, and Pearls, and Coſtly Array, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Do not become Women profeſſing Godlineſs with good Works;</hi> but them that do not profeſs Godlineſs, that are Shameleſs and Unſober, they may become ſuch Women that do not truſt in <hi>God,</hi> their proud Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may lead them to adorn themſelves with ſuch things, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which the Apoſtle forbids; but the holy Women of <hi>God,</hi> which profeſſed Godlineſs with good Works, and truſted in <hi>God,</hi> adorned themſelves not with plaiting the Hair, or wearing of Gold, or Pearls, or Coſtly Array; but <hi>with the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now conſider alſo, you Women that profeſs Godlineſs, and go under the name of Holy Women, who truſt in God, ſee that your
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:96751:278"/>ſelves and your Children, and all your young Women are Adorned and Arrayed, and have on this Ornament, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wills the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to put on, as the holy Women did of old; and be not of an unmeek and unquiet Spirit, and unſober and immodeſt, when you are admoniſhed and exhorted, nor act contrary to the holy Women of old that truſted in God, and ſuch as profeſſed Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And here you may ſee what care the Apoſtles had to keep the <hi>Saints</hi> (the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) their Eyes, Minds, and Spirits above the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gold, plaiting their Hair, and Pearls, and Coſtly Apparrel, which is the Glory of this World, which the holy Women that truſted in God, and profeſſed Godlineſs with good Works; theſe things were not to be their Adorning nor Ornaments, but (as is ſaid before) <hi>the hidden Man of the Heart,</hi> which was not <hi>Corrupt,</hi> even the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>quiet Spirit, which is with the Lord of great price:</hi> And this ought to be, and is the Adorning and Ornament of all the holy Women, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Godlineſs with good Works, and truſt in God.</p>
               <p>And all you that have been Convinced of the Lord's Truth, by his Spirit,<note place="margin">To refuſe the Glory of the World.</note> take heed of <hi>Satan</hi> taking you up into a Mountain, and of his ſhewing you the Glory of the World, and of your Minds and Eyes going after it, and receiving of it; and ſo in that you fall from the Spirit and Truth of God that did Convince you, and then to worſhip the Devil, the King of Pride, the God of the World, that abode not in the Truth, in whom there is no Truth; and he to lead your Minds and Eyes after every new vain Faſhion of the World that paſſeth away, and that lieth in wickedneſs; and ſo draweth you to the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which is Enmity to God, and into the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> by which ye do not know God; and then to ſuch the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> is hid, in whom the God of this World hath blinded their Minds; and in ſuch diſobedient Ones the Prince of the Air rules, and gets into them by diſobeying the Truth; and in ſuch <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not rule in their Hearts by Faith: And it is not like, when they make <hi>Shipwreck</hi> of it, and a good <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And therefore walk in the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and grow in his <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Knowledge of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that bruiſes the <hi>Serpent</hi>'s Head, and deſtroys the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> that you may all be eſtabliſhed upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Rock and Foundation.</p>
               <p>And if ye do believe in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> then, why do not you all train up your Children in the ſame?<note place="margin">To Train up our Children n the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of Grace.</note> Did not the Lord command the <hi>Jews</hi> to train up their <hi>Children</hi> in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and teach them to walk in it? And were not all the Males to be Circumciſed? And they that were not Circumciſed were to be cut off from the Congregation of the Lord: So are not all you that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the New Covenant of Grace, Light and Life, and the Goſpel of Salvation preached to every Creature; and the Grace of God which brings Salvation, that hath appeared unto all Men, to teach them to live Godly, and to deny Ungodlineſs? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, are not you all to train up your Children and Families in this <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which brings <hi>Salvation,</hi> and brings them into favour with God, that you may have the Comfort of your Children in this World, and in that which is Everlaſting? And that they may be
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:96751:278"/>Circumciſed with the Spirit of God, which he poureth out upon all Fleſh, that with his Spiritual Circumciſion the Body of Death and Sins of the Fleſh may be cut off, which are come into Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by Tranſgreſſion, that neither you nor they might dye in the Body of Death, and in the Sins of the Fleſh, and ſuch do not dye in the Lord; for they that are not Circumciſed with the Spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion are cut off from the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from the <hi>Church</hi> of the Living <hi>God</hi> written in Heaven. And therefore, if you will have the Comfort of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in this World, and that which is to come, train them up in the Fear of <hi>God,</hi> and in his <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> which <hi>Grace</hi> brings their <hi>Salvation,</hi> and brings them into Favour with <hi>God,</hi> and into the Spiritual Baptiſm and Circumciſion, ſo that they may ſerve and worſhip the Living <hi>God</hi> in his Spirit and Truth. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if Children and young People muſt be left, and let alone to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not be Admoniſhed, Exhorted and Reſtrained from the Evil and Vanities of the World, then why did <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were ſent of <hi>God,</hi> exhort the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to train up their Children in the Fear of the Lord, and to teach them his Law while they were young, that they might not depart from it when they were old? And if that they did, the Lord did judge them, as ye may read in the Scriptures of Truth; and if that they muſt be left to themſelves, and not reſtrained from Evil, then how came it to paſs that old <hi>Ely</hi> loſt his Life, and his Prieſthood,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ely,</hi> an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Parents.</note> and the Arke of God, for not reſtraining his Children from Evil?</p>
               <p>And again, if that they muſt be left to themſelves, why did the Prophets and the Apoſtles ſay, That they muſt not quench, nor vex, nor grieve, nor rebel againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> nor turn the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> into <hi>Wantonneſs,</hi> nor <hi>walk deſpitefully againſt the Spirit of Grace;</hi> but walk in the Spirit, and in the Truth, and in the Light, and to love it, and not to hate it; for they that do not love the Light, but hate it, are condemned by it, and ſo grow in the Condemnation, and are not in the Juſtification of Life.</p>
               <p>The Lord God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Circumciſe himſelf and his Children and Servants, that were bought with Money, and were born in his Houſe. He was to bring all his Males into this Covenant of outward Circumciſion; and the Lord ſaid, <hi>That Soul ſhall be cut off that is not Circumciſed, he hath broken my Covenant of outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Here you may ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> was to teach and inſtruct his Family and Servants, and he was not to keep any Man or Servant that was Uncircumciſed in his Family.</p>
               <p>Now you that profeſs the New Covenant,<note place="margin">True Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</note> are not you and all your Children and Servants to be Circumciſed with the Spirit of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion? And do not they that have not the Body of Death, and the Sins of the Fleſh cut off by Circumciſion, go down into the Pit, and not into Paradiſe, and the kingdom of God? And therefore may not ſuch Uncircumciſed by the Spirit hurt the Families of true Chriſtians in the Light?</p>
               <p>Therefore conſider, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not to ſuffer and of his Children and Servants, that were bought with his Money, or born in his Houſe, to be Uncircumciſed in the Old Covenant: This care the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:96751:279"/>Lord laid upon him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1696"/> in his Family, in the Old Covenant. Therefore conſider, you that profeſs the New Covenant of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, what Care lies upon you in your Families, of Teaching and Inſtructing your Servants and Children, and to bring them to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now, do not ſay but you are all warned in your Life-time; and therefore priſe your time, while you have it, that you ſpend it to the Honour and Glory of God.</hi>

               <head>An Epiſtle for them that are learned in Chriſt, to read and underſtand.</head>
               <p>THe Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 410.</note> 
                  <hi>In this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſt make unto all People a feaſt of fat things,</hi> &amp;c. And he will deſtroy in this Mountain the Face of the Covering caſt over all People, and the Veil that is ſpread over all Nations. And he will ſwallow up Death into Victory; and the Lord God will wipe away Tears from off all Faces, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p>Is not this Mountain <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt filleth the whole Earth.</note> that filleth the whole Earth, where this Feaſt of fat things is? And doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> through Death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Death and the Devil, the Power of Death, and ſo takes away the Veil and Covering that is ſpread over all Nations, that they may be covered with the <hi>Spirit</hi> that he pours upon all Fleſh? And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Moſes</hi> put a Veil over his Face, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> could not ſteadfaſtly look to the end of that which is to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; for their Minds were blinded. For, until this Day remains the ſame Veil untaken away. in the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> the Veil is upon their Hearts; which Veil is done away in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and when they ſhall turn to the Lord, the Veil ſhall be done away; as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>So, here you may ſee the Veil that was ſpread over the Hearts of People,<note place="margin">The Veil over Peoples Hearts, done away by Chriſt.</note> is done away by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and all they that are turned to the Lord, with open Face, behold, as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord. And the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne, ſhall feed his People, and dwell amongſt them; who hath made their Robes white in the Blood of the Lamb: And this is the Days of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom God gives for a Covenant of the People, to eſtabliſh the Earth. Sing O Heavens, and rejoyce O Earth, and break forth into Singing, O Mountains; for God hath comforted his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hath Mercy upon his afflicted. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, <hi>Go forth,</hi> unto them that are in Darkneſs, <hi>ſhew your ſelves;</hi> and they ſhall feed in Paſtures: For he that hath Mercy on them, ſhall lead them, and by the Springs of Water ſhall he guide them, <hi>Iſai</hi> 49. For God gave <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Covenant to the People, for a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to open the blind Eyes, to bring out the Priſioners out of Priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the Priſon-Houſes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.2, 6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <pb n="549" facs="tcp:96751:279"/>
               <p>So, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1686"/> we that do witneſs this do praiſe the Lord God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with Men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his People,</hi> Rev. 21.3.</p>
               <p>This is the Day of the New Covenant, which People enjoy in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord ſaith, <hi>I will ranſom them from the Power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plague: O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13.14.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law: But thanks be to God, which gives us the Victory, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.</p>
               <p>So, here you may ſee the Grave had its Victory,<note place="margin">Chriſt gives Victory over Death and the Grave.</note> and Death hath its Sting; which is Sin: But the Strength of Sin is the Law: But <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives us the Victory; who makes an end of Sin, the Sting of Death; as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. And who through Death deſtroys Death and the Power of Death, and is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs ſake, to every one that believes; and ſo are dead to the Law, by the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith unto the <hi>Jews, Verily, verily, he that hears my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life,</hi> (Mark, Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life) <hi>and ſhall not come into Condemnation; but hath paſt from Death unto Life.</hi> Then they have paſt from the Sting of Death, which is Sin: <hi>And,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>we know that we are paſt from Death unto Life, becauſe we love the Brethren; for he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abideth in Death,</hi> John 5.24. 1 John 2.44.</p>
               <p>So, if they were paſt from Death to Life, then they were paſt from Death, and his Sting, which is Sin, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who deſtroys Death, and makes and End of Sin.</p>
               <p>And again <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Jews, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the Hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God; and they that hear, ſhall live,</hi> John 5.25. Chriſt ſaying, <hi>The Hour cometh, and now is, that the Dead ſhould hear his Voice:</hi> So that they paſt from the Death that came by <hi>Adam</hi> into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 2. And ſo they thanked God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who gave them the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over Death and Sin, Death's Sting; ſo as it is written, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi> For Chriſt, as I ſaid before, makes an End of <hi>Sin,</hi> that is the <hi>Sting</hi> of Death, and through Death deſtroys Death and the Devil, the Power of Death. So thanks be to God, through and by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> we have the Victory unto Everlaſting Life, over the <hi>Grave, Death,</hi> and its <hi>Sting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</note> 
                  <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except a Man be born of the Spirit, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God; neither can he enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. &amp; John 3.3, 5.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſt from Death to Life,</hi> John 5.24. <hi>And he that believeth not is condemned already: And he that believeth on the Son of God ſhall not
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:96751:280"/>periſh, but have eternal Life.</hi> And again, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.15, 16, 18.</p>
               <p>Now this Death which <hi>Adam</hi> fell into was a ſpiritual Death; for by one Man's Diſobedience or Offence, namely <hi>Adam,</hi> Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation. So all Men are under this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Condemnation in <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall. Even ſo, by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of one, namely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the free Gift came upon all Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtification of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
               <p>So they that do not believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in Chriſt abide in Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Light,</hi> as he Commands, <hi>John</hi> 12.36. they abide in ſpiritual Death and Darkneſs, and under the Judgment and Condemnation in <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, in the periſhing ſtate: But he that believeth on the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath Everlaſting Life, and paſſeth from Death to Life, and ſhall not periſh in Darkneſs, and is not condemned, but comes out of Condemnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he that believeth not in the <hi>Son</hi> of God is condemned, and ſhall not ſee Life; and the Wrath of God abideth on him. Such abide in the periſhing ſtate, in the Death and Darkneſs in <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, under Judgment and Condemnation: But they that believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> do come out of Darkneſs, and paſſes from Death to Life, and come from under Judgment and Condemnation, that came upon all Men by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one Man <hi>Adam,</hi> and come from under the Wrath of God, and from under Judgment and Condemnation into Favour with God, and into Eternal and Everlaſting Life in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and ſo have Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Death, Darkneſs and Sin, its <hi>Sting,</hi> and the periſhing State, and the Grave of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Fall from Life Eternal; and ſo are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that have part in the firſt Reſurrection in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> On ſuch the ſecond Death ſhall have no Power, for they are in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Reſurrection, and Eternal Everlaſting Life, and their Names are written in the Book of Life; who deſtroys Death, and Hell, and the Devil, the Power of Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.10, 14, 15. And caſts the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Death and Hell, into the Lake of Fire, that burns with Brimſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">The laſt Enemy that ſhall b de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed is Death</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</hi> But as it is written in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up into Victory: For by Man,</hi> namely <hi>Adam, came Death; and by Man,</hi> namely <hi>Chriſt, came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead: For, as in</hi> Adam <hi>all died, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, as by the one Man <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin and Death came over all; and by the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Life cometh over all. And by Nature we are born of <hi>Adam;</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are made the Children of God, by Grace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and quickened and made alive, and reſtored to Life Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him. And <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who puts all things under his Feet, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues Death under him; who through Death deſtroys Death, the laſt Enemy, and the Devil, the Power of Death, and ſo makes an End of <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Sting</hi> of Death, and brings in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the way of Righteouſneſs is Life; and in the Path-way there is no Death.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Lord ſaith, <hi>Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth; and the former ſhall not be remembred nor come into mind: But, be you glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I create: For, behold, I create Jeruſalem a Rejoycing, and her People a Joy. And I will Rejoyce in Jeruſalem, and Joy in my People, and the Voice of Weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the Voice of Crying,</hi> Iſa. 65.17, 18.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in his <hi>General Epiſtle</hi> to the Church, <hi>We, according to his promiſe, look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13.</p>

And I John, ſaw the holy City, new Jeruſalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband. And I heard a great Voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with Men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his People; and God ſhall be with them, and be their God; and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ſhall be no more Death,</hi> mark, no more Death, <hi>in new Jeruſalem, neither Sorrow, nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more Pain: For the former things are paſſed away. And he that ſate upon the Throne ſaid, Behold, I make all things new. And he ſaid unto me, Write, for theſe things are true and faithful. And he ſaid unto me, It is done: I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, I will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that is athirſt of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely; he that overcometh ſhall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son,</hi> Rev. 21.1. to the 8th.</p>

                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is below, is in Bondage with her Children; but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all, which believe in the <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And in this New and Heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> there is no Death nor Night; and the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk in the <hi>Light</hi> of this New and Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For the Glory of God doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is the <hi>Light</hi> thereof; and the Lord God and the Lamb are the Temple of this New and Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is from above; and the Lord cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates this Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, this Heavenly and New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not made by the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of Mens Hands, nor of Wood and Stone; neither are Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple caſt in Priſon for not mending or repairing a Temple there; for there is no outward Temple in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it.

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 419.</note> Something was upon me to write unto you, that ſuch among <hi>Friends,</hi> who marry, and provide great Dinners, that inſtead thereof, it will be of a good <hi>Savour</hi> on ſuch Occaſions, that they may be put in mind at ſuch times, to give ſomething to the Poor that be Widows and Fatherleſs,<note place="margin">To be Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and relieve the Poor.</note> and ſuch like, to make them a Feaſt, or to Refreſh them: And this, I look upon, would be a very good <hi>Savour,</hi> to feaſt the Poor that cannot feaſt you again; and would be a good Practiſe and Example, and would be a means to keep the Mind to the Lord; and in remembrance of the Poor; for <hi>they that give to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and the Lord will re-pay them.</hi> And I do really believe, what ever they give, leſs or more, according to their Ability, cheerfully, they will not have the leſs at the Years End, for the Lord loves a cheerful Giver. I know this Practice hath been uſed by ſome Twenty Years ago. And ſo it is not only to give the Poor a little Victuals, which you cannot eat your ſelves, but give them a little Money, that the Lord hath bleſſed you with; and give it to ſome of the <hi>Womens Meetings</hi> for to diſtribute to the Poor: So you will have the Bleſſings of the Lord, and the Bleſſings of the Poor: And ſo, to be of a free noble <hi>Spirit,</hi> above all the churliſh Miſers and Nigards, and narrow <hi>Spirits</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things I do recommend to you (though it may look a little ſtrange) to weigh and conſider the thing, it will both be of a good Report, and a good Savour, and manifeſts a ſelf-denial and openneſs of Heart, and of the general Love of <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>And what do you know, but the Lord hath ſet you there to preach in Life, and Word, and good Converſation? Therefore while you are there, mind your Service for God, who hath all things in his Hand: <hi>And a Sparrow cannot fall to the Ground without his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Mountain that filleth the whole Earth; and ſo you will feel him there.</p>
